A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B000000WGF	5	Paula Abdul 's 1988 debut FOREVER YOUR GIRL sold five million copies in a year since the album 's release . <sssss> The same thing happened with Mariah Carey 's self-titled debut 2 years later , Madonna 's LIKE A VIRGIN album in 1984 and Whitney Houston 's 1985 self-titled debut . <sssss> This album remained on the charts through spring 1990 . <sssss> When STRAIGHT UP debuted on the radio in late 1988 , the sales of the album rapidly increased . <sssss> Other hits include THE WAY THAT YOU LOVE ME , KNOCKED OUT , OPPOSITES ATTRACT , NEXT TO YOU , COLD HEARTED and the title track . <sssss> Another ten-track album with seven hits that I know of is Bryan Adams ' RECKLESS album . <sssss> A must for urban music fans . <sssss> Also it 's ideal for nightclub play .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B000000WGF	4	Though Paula Abdul first gained notoriety for choreographing Janet Jackson 's CONTROL videos , her debut FOREVER YOUR GIRL managed to thrust her into the pop stratosphere , firmly taking a place right next to ... Janet Jackson . <sssss> How 's that for karma ? <sssss> Of course , it helped that she was fully armed with an album full of strong dance-pop tunes -- ' Straight Up ' , ' Cold Hearted ' , and you know the rest . <sssss> Even the non-singles here are terrific , particularly ' State Of Attraction ' and ' I Need You ' . <sssss> The only real sore point is the album 's sole ballad ' Next To You ' , which did nothing but remind us that singing was never really Abdul 's strong suit . <sssss> Otherwise , this is a nice reminder of what an engaging and sincere performer Abdul was , and why current pop princesses like Britney and Christina do n't hold a candle to our Paula .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B000000WGF	5	And the results speak for themselves ! <sssss> With her angelically squeaky voice , bubbly personality , and take-charge attitude , this chick was a real force back in the late '80s . <sssss> Along with Janet Jackson ( " JJ " as she 's known to the playas of da world ) , Paula Abdul almost singlehandedly drove the music industry forward , back in ' 88 . <sssss> Along the way she broke new ground in her videos . <sssss> Remember that cat she flirted with in the " Opposites Attract " video ? <sssss> It inspired Roger Rabbit and Beavis and Butthead . <sssss> Remember the sizzling choreography in the risque " Cold Hearted " video ? <sssss> It inspired " Melrose Place " and ABC 's " The Bachelor " . <sssss> Simply put , Abdul paved the way for future imitators like J-Lo and even Gloria Estephan . <sssss> ( What in the world ever happened to her ???? <sssss> ) . <sssss> What a career Abdul has had !! <sssss> From a Laker girl to a singer to an analyst on one of TV 's biggest shows ever , Paula A is a true hero to women and men of all ages ! <sssss> I WISH HER LUCK FROM HERE ON OUT !!!! <sssss> MAYBE SHE AND SIMON WILL FINALLY GET TOGETHER ON IDOL 'S 3RD SEASON !!!!! <sssss> LATER , DUDES !!!!!!!!!!! 
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B000000WGF	5	No matter what controversy Paula Abdul tends to generate these days , there used to be a time when she was much more well-respected , and rightly so with this high-energy , hits-heavy album . <sssss> " Straight Up " and " Forever Your Girl " are two songs that really say " bring back the 80s " . <sssss> A lot of people said that she had no singing talent , and while I can agree on the fact that her whiny , nasal wail is not the most pleasant singing voice that somebody could 've been blessed with , she still knows how to sing with energy and passion .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B000000WGF	2	I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby . <sssss> Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul 's voice now gets on my nerves , and that her songs though they had their place and time in 1989 just do n't hold up well today . <sssss> Songs like " Straight Up " , " Knocked Out " , and " The Way That You Love Me " , just do n't infect me like some old pop songs do like The Emotions " Best of My Love " or Lovin ' Spoonfuls " Summer in the City " ... . <sssss> get the picture ? <sssss> Unless your an Abdul fanatic , all I can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious hooks ... <sssss> I think if Madonna , or Deborah Gibson ( who have stronger voices ) sang these dittys they may hold up better .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000000WGF	4	There was a time when " Paula Abdul " was a cheerleader for the " L.A. Lakers " . <sssss> There was also a time when she was as popular as " Madonna " and " Janet Jackson " , and that was because of " Forever Your Girl " . <sssss> The album was huge when it came out , and seemed to produce an endless supply of singles . <sssss> Included is probably her biggest hit " Straight Up " , plus " Opposites Attract " , " Cold Hearted " , and " Forever Your Girl " . <sssss> All the other tracks are almost as good , and a favorite of mine is " Next To You " . <sssss> She does actually have a " Greatest Hits " out as well , and six of these songs are on that , plus " Rush Rush " , " Promise Of A New Day " , and others . <sssss> It 's too bad that now she 's mostly known for judging " American Idol " . <sssss> Some people will never know she used to make videos with animated cats .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B000000WGF	5	Long before Paula Abdul was a judge on American Idol she was a very succesful singer , actually she was among the most popular in the world for a few years 1988-1992 and had 5-6 number 1 singles in the US . <sssss> Although she was not the best of singers , her voice was thin and girlish it was personal and unique and always interesting to listen to . <sssss> On the other hand Paula was a great entertainer , fantastic dancer and very charismatic . <sssss> She had initially been a cheerleader and choreographer but eventually those qualities would be useful for her own career . <sssss> Not too surprisingly Paula is better on uptempo songs . <sssss> Babyface penned first single " Knocked Out " was n't a hit and neither second single " ( It 's Just ) The Way That You Love Me " until it later was re-released . <sssss> The album was n't going particulary well either , but everything changed when third single " Staight Up " was released . <sssss> It went to number # 1 and made Paula a overnight sensation , the album eventually reached # 1 aswell , but it took 62 weeks , a record for an album . <sssss> Midtempos " Forever Your Girl " " Cold Hearted " and the last single of this album , a duet with the Wild Pair " Opposite Attracts " would also reach the top of the charts , making Paula Abdul one of the most popular artists of 1988-1989 and " Forever Your Girl " has now sold around 17 Million copies . <sssss> Some of the songs have dated but not everything , campared to alot of her peers this album is still full of good quality that not always sound like typical 80 's music and the hitsingles talk for themselves . <sssss> The first of only 3 albums she released is undoubtly the best and worth a place in a music collection .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B000000WGF	5	Selling around 7 million , makes a good state , that this album is no mistake to buy it ! <sssss> , Paula Abdul debut album embraces the music of the end of th 80 's and the welcoming of the 90 's , she should be remember as the top artist of that slack of time cuz she was , better than Madonna and Janet . <sssss> For my taste 9 of the 10 album cuts are great . <sssss> Next to you ( should be left out ) , The other songs are definetily great ! <sssss> and the 6 singles release in this album are just classic , sadly as most of all the albums in the eighties the radio version were slightly different but if you want that The Greatest Hits will do you good ( beautifuly crafted all the singles version , way to go Virgin Records !!! <sssss> ) . <sssss> But as for all Forever Your Girl will be considered always one of time best debut album .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000000WGF	4	Say what you will about Paula Abdul -- she does n't sing very well and her music is often derivative -- but one thing is certain : she came out with some of the catchiest songs of the 1980s . <sssss> This album has all the ingredients of a hit : sharp beats , slammin ' grooves , and Abdul 's whiny voice , which , in a strange way , sounds good . <sssss> Standouts include " The Way That You Love Me " , the Babyface-penned " Knocked Out " , and the memorable " Cold Hearted " . <sssss> In the age of pale imitators like Britney Spears , we need an artist like Abdul more badly now than ever . <sssss> She was never remembered as a " deep " artist like poseur Alanis Morrissette , but she delivered some well-crafted pop tunes in her day .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B0000013G5	5	This is pop / R & B at its greatest . <sssss> Toni Braxton burst onto the scene with this being her debut in 1993 . <sssss> She had already had a bit of success with the minor hit " Love Shoulda Brought You Home " from the Boomerang soundtrack the year before * which is featured on here * so she was already creating a buzz . <sssss> This album was a surprising smash hitting # 1 on the album charts , going 8x platinum , and spawning several hit singles for Ms. Braxton . <sssss> The three big hits on here are also the best songs which are " Another Sad Love Song " , " Breathe Again " , and my personal favorite , the up-lifting 1994 hit " You Mean the World To Me " . <sssss> All three of these were huge hit singles and made the top 10 . <sssss> These were not the only singles though . <sssss> " Toni Braxton " also produced moderate / minor hits with " Seven Whole Days " , " How Many Ways " , and the great " I Belong To You " . <sssss> In all , over half the album was released as singles and became hits . <sssss> Definitely worth the money ! <sssss> It 's a grear album and a great reflection on the early / mid 90 's R&B circuit seeing as how Babyface ( " Take A Bow " - Madonna , " I 'll Make Love To You " - Boyz II Men , " Never Forget You " - Mariah Carey ) did a great deal of writing / producing . <sssss> Toni Braxton would continue to be extremely successful through-out the 90 's and into 2000 with her huge sophomore release " Secrets " and successful third album " The Heat " ... both which would give her several more great hit songs . <sssss> It 's a shame her latest release " More Than A Woman " has not lived up to previous standards . <sssss> Toni is a great talent .
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B0000013G5	5	After thirteen years in the music business , Toni Braxton is an R&B legend . <sssss> On her debut album , this one , Braxton pleases her fans with ANOTHER SAD SONG , which " hips and hops " . <sssss> It " says so much " like a similarly entitled Elton John composition and recording . <sssss> BREATHE AGAIN is very smooth R&B and so is YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME . <sssss> Some of these songs were written by Diane Warren who wrote hits for Michael Bolton . <sssss> Braxton 's rise to fame led to a duet recording with ex-Doobie Brother Michael McDonald for his MOTOWN 2 album , released last year . <sssss> The other songs are great . <sssss> There is a short reprise of BA , which is Track 12 of this CD . <sssss> Braxton also caught the attention of Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds and Antonio " L.A. " Reid who served as producers and session musicians for this album . <sssss> Currently , Reid is president of Arista Records who also produced music for Avril LaVigne .
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B0000013G5	4	" Toni Braxton " , an eponymous debut of one of the sultriest ( and prettiest ) popstars of the day , is one of the defining albums of the mid-1990 's -- the era when charts and radio were ruled by tracks penned and produced by Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds . <sssss> Together with soundtrack to " Waiting to Exhale " film and TLC 's sophomore effort " CrazySexyCool " , Toni 's first full-length album perhaps is best in capturing the smoothness and class of Babyface-handed music ( here aided especially by Antonio " L.A " Reid ) . <sssss> The best three cuts are the first three , Toni 's breakthrough " Another Sad Love Song " , tender ballad " Breathe Again " and more than six minutes ' long jam " Seven Whole Days " -- all three boast splendid arrangements . <sssss> Then the quality of songs somewhat drops and gets higher with track number 7 , " Love Shoulda Brought You Home " from 1992 movie " The Boomerang " . <sssss> Again a typical Babyface composition , as well as " You Mean The World To Me " , which followed " Another Sad Love Song " and " Breathe Again " as the third single from this album . <sssss> " I Belong To You " was the fourth single , appearing in late 1994 , and the radio remix edit was definitely better than the album version . <sssss> Conversely , " How Many Ways " original version appearing here is better-done than R. Kelly remix from 1995 . <sssss> The album is wrapped up by Toni 's own song " Best Friend " . <sssss> The European version of this CD also contains a mix of Braxton 's first hit ever , the Babyface duet " Give You My Heart " , also from the " Boomerang " . <sssss> The album had not that big chart success as it would deserve , especially because of its timing -- released in fall of 1993 , it could not compete too well on the charts with Mariah Carey 's " Music Box " and Janet Jackson 's " janet " . <sssss> However , its quality is undeniable . <sssss> Not a groundbreaker , but surely a fair shot . <sssss> If someone once asks you what was like to turn a radio on in mid-1990 's , play this CD to him .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B0000013G5	4	When her debut album was released , Toni Braxton was heralded as the next big thing in black pop . <sssss> Strikingly attractive with a sassy short hairdo and a soulfully deep voice , the public was introduced to her with a duet she did with Babyface for the Boomerang Soundtrack . <sssss> Very soon , she broke the Top 40 , and her proper debut single Another Sad Love Song also took a big jump on the singles chart , make top 10 and was certified gold . <sssss> Her star then rose and she scored the platinum-selling # 3 hit Breathe Again , which ibn my opinion , is her best single ever and a classic soulful song . <sssss> She scored one more Top 10 with You Mean The World To Me before releasing the last double A-side single How Many Ways / I Belong To You. <sssss> A classic debut that introduced a pretty face and soulful voice that was somewhat different from many others . <sssss> A slew of songs that were written by various people and helmed by then R&B masteros Babyface , LA Reid and Daryl Simmons , the Stock-Aitken-Waterman of R&B . <sssss> Unfortunately , Braxton felt prey to commercialism and the tempations of being routine with her second album onwards , doin ' herself injustice by recording songs by Diane Warren . <sssss> It really spelt the end of what was to be an amazing career . <sssss> One bankruptcy later , Braxton was less able to reclaim her lost crown years later . <sssss> Nonetheless , this album is one hell of a good debut for the 90 's .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0000013G5	4	Toni Braxton burst onto the music scene with the smoldering debut LOVE SHOULDA BROUGHT YOU HOME from the Boomerang soundtrack . <sssss> I love the story of how she got her shot in the business - this song was originally presented to Anita Baker who passed but suggested that the woman who sang the demo ( Toni ) sing the actual song ! <sssss> Toni got the shot and the rest is history as they say . <sssss> This album was a very successful debut earning Toni multiple top ten r & b ; hits and subsequently grammies & other awards . <sssss> The most wonderful thing about this collection is the collaboration between the singer and the writers / producers , LA & Babyface . <sssss> All were definitely in the creative zone when this debut was put together because virtually every song was a hit but moreso , timeless since I still have this disc in heavy rotation . <sssss> I 've continued to buy her albums because she is one of the most distinctly unique vocalists still in the business who when given excellent material turns it out ! <sssss> Of the 12 tracks there are only 2 that I think are just ok and do n't listen to frequently , CANDLELIGHT & LOVE AFFAIR . <sssss> And of the others my favorites are : BREATHE AGAIN , YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME , BEST FRIEND , SEVEN WHOLE DAYS , HOW MANY WAYS & LOVE SHOULDA BROUGHT YOU HOME . <sssss> I 'd highly recommend this cd as one of the best debuts by an r & b ; female vocalist from that era because it still stands the test of time .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B0000013G5	5	One of the best albums of the 90s , this album had some of the most momentous crossover appeal ever . <sssss> During its first couple of years it was all over black urban radio , yet it was tastefully restrained enough to have continued success on adult contemporary and soft rock radio stations to this day . <sssss> " Another Sad Love Song " , " Breathe Again " , " You Mean The World To Me " , " How Many Ways " and " Seven Whole Days " are among the true gems of contemporary R&B . <sssss> Her next album , Secrets , had a couple of sizable hits and is generally good , if not as brilliant as this . <sssss> However , after that , she was forced to declare bankruptcy , and since then , her quest to reclaim her wealth has resulted in a series of subpar albums that simply can not touch the greatness of this one .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B0000013G5	5	It 's been a decade since this album was released and we can still hear several songs on the radio such as : " another sand love song " which was the first single of the album , was certified Gold in the US , won a Grammy award for " best female pop vocal performance " and became a # 1 hit . <sssss> The second single , " breath again " was also certified Gold , became also a # 1 hit and won a Grammy award for " best female pop vocal performance " in 1994 , the success of the song was so big that Toni also realesed this song in spanish , the tittle was " respirar " , the third single " seven whole days " was also a hit , the song made it to the Top 10 as the fifth single " you mean the world to me " , the sixth single which was " how many ways " was a Top 40 . <sssss> Thanks to this hit singles and the song that was part of the " Boomerang " soundtrack . <sssss> That was Toni 's first single ( " love shoulda brought you home " ) . <sssss> This album sold 10 million copies world-wide ( was a # 1 in The Billboard 200 for 2 weeks ) and brought Toni the 1993 Grammy " Best new artist " and showed the world the new treasure that was in the music market . <sssss> Actually I did n't buy this album when was realesed , I bought it in 1997 when Toni 's album " secrets " was on its top and because I liked so much " secrets " I decided to buy this one and I know that " secrets " is the sequel of this album with very good lyrics . <sssss> I can also say that this production was produced by hit singer / song writer / producer Babyface ( " Waiting to exhale " , " Boomerang " between other soundtracks ) and Antonio L.A Reid ( producer of singers like Pink or Avril Lavigne ) . <sssss> You wo n't be soory if you buy this album and besides , it 's a classic . <sssss> Good work Toni !!
A149OQJD0ASI07	B0000013G5	5	Toni Braxton really can sing and she 's one of several artists still around whose talent gets ignored because she 's not the latest " flavor of the month " . <sssss> This debut really was back in the " good ole days " as far as her career ... remember that Babyface sound was just coming in with artists like Toni and TLC . <sssss> She won a couple of Grammys for this album and they were well deserved . <sssss> This is n't necessarily a happy , uplifting kind of album , but it 's a cool , smooth vibed LP that 's perfect for every mood of modern day relationships as " relationship " type music goes . <sssss> " Seven Whole Days " , " Another Sad Love Song " and " Love Shoulda Brought You Home " are the midtempo , though scorned lover-inspired tunes that made Toni famous ( though my dad still laments 10 + years later that Toni 's music is " never happy " ) . <sssss> Everybody either remembers or should know that " Love Shoulda Brought You Home " was the blockbuster single that emerged from the soundtrack of the 1992 hit movie " Boomerang " -- I 'll never be able to hear this song without that Halle Berry-coined phrase from the movie going through my head ( " Love ? Do n't talk 2 me about Love !!!! Love , Shoulda Brought ' cha ass home last night !!!! " -- a timeless catchphrase , at least in Black America ) . <sssss> Her quote , unquote " happy " song on this LP is " Breathe Again " , another hit single conjuring images of deep love on another level . <sssss> Toni 's music is less soulful and more distressed than even Mary J. Blige 's early stuff , but Toni 's always had the better voice . <sssss> She 's not quite a Whitney or Mariah , but she 's definitely above Mary J. , Janet Jackson and Aaliyah -- top female R&B ; artists who all shined in the '90s . <sssss> This is , however , another " must have " CD for all 1990s R&B ; fans . <sssss> This debut was easily one of the Top 10 albums ( in popularity and sales ) of the decade . <sssss> Recommended .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B0000013G5	4	This is the debut from Toni Braxton , a daughter of a fundamentalist preacher . <sssss> Truth be told , Braxton 's rise to fame happened by accident . <sssss> Producers LA Reid and Babyface gave her the song that was rejected by Anita Baker but would later appear on the soundtrack to " Boomerang " : " Love Shoulda Brought You Home " . <sssss> This smoothed-out ballad put Braxton on the map , and soon after her debut album surfaced . <sssss> It 's a fine collection of mid-tempo numbers and sap-free ballads . <sssss> " Breathe Again " is one of Babyface 's most inspired songs , and Braxton 's gusty voice gives it the urgency it demands . <sssss> She succeeds similarly in " You Mean the World to Me " and " Seven Whole Days " . <sssss> But my two songs of choice are the perky love ditty " I Belong to You " and the very popular mid-tempo " Another Sad Love Song " . <sssss> This album went on to sell millions and established Braxton as a multiplatinum r & b singer . <sssss> A promising debut that will make a nice addition to your collection .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B0000013G5	5	Ah ... ! <sssss> I recall the days when Toni Braxton was more like the girl next door . <sssss> Why , she put out some tunes that were melodic , hopeful and full of fire . <sssss> She got more mileage out of crooning a simple ' sugar-sugar ' than any of the current-day , first-name only , video-ready female products posing as singers could only dream of getting -- even with their entire bloated production and bombast . <sssss> And with their air brushed videos playing in overdrive . <sssss> See , I think it was because we were introduced to Toni by the song from the moovy " Boomerang " ( " Love Shoulda Brought You Home " ) that we had the opportunity to fall in love with her voice , 'cause they were playing the tune for a while on the radio , sans a video . <sssss> And -- in what must be the greatest understatement in ten years -- the sista can sing , ya 'll . <sssss> But , when we all got a chance to see her , whoo-wee ! <sssss> What a woman , what a star . <sssss> So , while I miss Toni 's innocent days , I can appreciate her in full bloom , as it were . <sssss> This , Toni 's inaugural CD , gets my greatest compliment , " Put It On and Let It Ride , Baby " . <sssss> There are no missed spots , no kind of vocal faux pas , no wasted rhythms , no missteps in sequencing or a single unpleasant track in this entire recording . <sssss> Nothing can get too much better than this -- peak form Laface with ' ready for the world ' Braxton . <sssss> If you have n't played it for yourself in a while , do yourself a favor : get your favorite adult kool-aid , place yourself in relax mode and play it back to back a few times . <sssss> See ? <sssss> Like I said . <sssss> Immaculate . <sssss> And you simply will NEVER get tired of it .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B0000013GH	4	Highlights are You 're Making Me High , Talking In His Sleep , Find Me A Man , Let It Flow , Why Should I Care , Come On Over Here and I Love Me Some Him . <sssss> Filler ? <sssss> Not a lot , but Un-break My Heart comes close and In The Late Of Night / Toni 's Secrets is OK and nothing to speak of . <sssss> So I guess that means no filler ! <sssss> ^_^ ; ; Cover Art : A-Songwriting : B+V ocals : B-Vocal Emotion : A-Production : B+O verall : 4.3754.375 = 4.384.38 stars .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B0000013GH	3	Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career . <sssss> This album is pretty good but it 's also a mixed bag as well . <sssss> After a thousand listens to , Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating ! <sssss> You 're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever , love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat . <sssss> How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton . <sssss> The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I ca n't understand what she is singing , she needs to enuicate her words . <sssss> This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that 's pretty much it .
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B0000013GH	5	In 1992 , after catching the attention of Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds and current Arista Records president Antonio " L.A. " Reid , Toni Braxton landed a contract with Arista 's subsidiary label , LaFace . <sssss> That label , which is a combination of the nicknames , was founded by Edmonds and Reid . <sssss> When Braxton 's debut album was released the following year , she became an instant success . <sssss> R&B , rap and hip-hop fans fell in love with her talented singing vocals . <sssss> The most memorable track from this album is UN-BREAK MY HEART , which is of course , smooth R&B . <sssss> I just love the sound of Edmonds ' guitar on that song . <sssss> When I first heard the song in 1996 when this album was released , I thought it was Gloria Estefan who recorded it since her voice sounds much like Braxton 's . <sssss> That same year , Edmonds produced Eric Clapton 's hit CHANGE THE WORLD from the movie PHENOMENON starring John Travolta . <sssss> The other songs are great . <sssss> A few years later , Reid would do business with another great artist , Avril LaVigne .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B0000013GH	3	Toni Braxton 's sophomore set attempted to build on the huge success of her debut , while at the same time maybe trying something a little different here and there . <sssss> Hearing first single ' You 're Makin ' Me High ' actually gave most ( including me ) hope that the " different " part might actually be worth checking out . <sssss> Sad to say , she fails to follow through on the promise of that track , instead padding SECRETS with many average-at-best moments that do nothing but diminish her unique vocal talent . <sssss> Ballads abound here , though a few , like the acoustic guitar driven ' Let It Flow ' and ' There 's No Me Without You ' , though hopelessly hokey , at least allow Braxton some solid room to showcase her lower range . <sssss> But then you have ' How Could An Angel Break My Heart ' , replete with soulless and near-offensive Kenny G sax work and the Diane Warren weeper ' Un-Break My Heart ' , which has now been rendered unlistenable -- I 'm sorry , but Braxton manages to get the very worst of Warren 's Celine Dion throwaways ( I do n't think I need to elaborate further ) . <sssss> The rest of the disc is made up of material that 's not quite as offensive but does nothing to enhance Braxton 's stature . <sssss> Though not nearly as bad as Braxton 's subsequent third album THE HEAT , SECRETS nonetheless leaves one wondering when Braxton will or even can live up to her far more promising debut .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0000013GH	4	Toni 's sophomore set continued her progression from an excellent debut . <sssss> This is a strong collection of songs where Toni 's vocal phrasings and the song melodies are beautiful from one track to the next . <sssss> On the Babyface productions , it 's like he & Toni are both halves of one brain - and although more Adult Contemporary than straight R&B ; , the songs are still memorable , melodic and beautiful . <sssss> I saw Toni on a commercial recently which prompted my little Toni-athon and rediscovered singles that I had n't listened to in a while : THERE 'S NO ME WITHOUT YOU , WHY SHOULD I CARE , IN THE LATE OF NIGHT and FIND ME A MAN in addition to the " hits " that I love : LET IT FLOW , I LOVE ME SOME HIM , UNBREAK MY HEART & YOU 'RE MAKING ME HIGH . <sssss> Overall this is a great second offering from one of my favorite vocalists who we need to hear more new music from ! <sssss> Please come back soon , Toni !
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B0000013GH	5	This a a brilliant album from Toni . <sssss> Beautiful ballads throughout and her voice is so soothing and sultry . <sssss> My particular favourites are " Un-break my heart " and " How could an Angel break my heart " , but all songs are good . <sssss> This is an album I can listen to over and over again ... beautiful . <sssss> The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos of Toni . <sssss> If you 're looking for an album for a romantic dinner or ' something ' , then look no further . <sssss> Track # 12 though , I think is a trick ... it does n't exist .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B0000013GH	4	When any artist 's first album is so on fire as Toni Braxton 's debut was , it 's a pretty safe assumption that subsequent releases will have a hard time living up to it , and that , to a moderate extent , is the case here . <sssss> She still had some fire left in her , as evidenced on the hip-hoppish but respectable hit " You 're Makin ' Me High " and the emotional ballad " Unbreak My Heart " . <sssss> Also good are the ballad " Let It Flow " and the sultry , teasing ditty " Talking In His Sleep " . <sssss> Unfortunately , before she had a chance to make a third album , the bankruptcy set in , and since then she has been just a shell of her former self on every album she 's made after this one .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0000013GH	5	Arista did a good thing buy releasing this cd full of Toni 's best hits as well as a few sounds from the vaults we havent heard . <sssss> Overall I think they did a good job of suming up all the hits that helped to make toni who she is today . <sssss> Like what ? <sssss> * Give you my heart * Love shoulda brought you home * Breathe Again * Your makign me high * Let it Flow * Un-break My heart * I dont want to * Just be a man about it * Hit the freeway * Whatchu need * Un-break my heart ( remix ) I think these songs right here are the best on the cd but everything here is good . <sssss> The bonus tracks are good but " whatchu need " is the best one to me . <sssss> For all the toni fans you might not want to bother with this being that you probably have all her albums ... . <sssss> for those who like toni and missed out on a few ... this is a must have . <sssss> Those who never knew anything about toni ... this is also one for you to check out . <sssss> Now that she is on Blackground records ... we will see what she comes out with next but until then ....... . <sssss> this is it ! <sssss> Get it !
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B0000013GH	5	I bought this album back in 1997 and actually I do n't know why i bought it I think that was that I saw on cable the " you 're making me high " video and I saw in a store and bought it . <sssss> This album is amazing the lyrics are beautiful , there 's no a song that I do n't like , the rhythms are very good also and besides that I like this album it was one of the biggest hits of 1997 with song such as : " you 're making me high " ( my own favorite ) the song did it to # 1 in the Hot 100 , Hot R&B song and Club dance charts another hit and maybe Toni 's biggest song " un-break my heart " is also in this album " Un-break " became also a # 1 , another great song is the soft " how could an angel break my heart " were features Kenny G . <sssss> Here 's also one song from the 1996 hit soundtrack " waiting to exhaale " the song is " let it flow " . <sssss> Actually I love all the ssongs in this album from the first one " come on over here " until " I the late of night " . <sssss> This album won 3 or 4 Grammy awards ( I 'm not sure about the amount ) and sold over 10 million copies worldwide .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B0000013GH	5	Toni 's sophomore effort is one of her best albums ever , a great follow up to her hit debut album . <sssss> Despite the title , there are no secrets here , just some great music that will stand the test of time . <sssss> We got a taste of this album in 1995 with the Waiting To Exhale soundtrack , where her hit song Let It Flow ( written by Babyface ) was included , well the classic song makes a return on this album . <sssss> The first single " You 're Makin ' Me High " is a nice R&B jam , a nice introduction for those that do n't have the album . <sssss> " Come On Over Here " is another great R&B song , which should have been a single . <sssss> Her classic ballad " Unbreak My Heart " displays the emotional devestation felt after losing a loved one . <sssss> " Talking In His Sleep " , " There 's No Me Without You " , " How Could An Angel Break My Heart " and " Let It Flow " are all classic Toni ballads , as well as " Let It Flow " and " Unbreak My Heart " . <sssss> This is a crowning acheivement for Toni , I felt I could relate with what she was saying . <sssss> Overall this is a must have album , it has some really great ballads and some great uptempo songs by that singer with the sexy voice , Toni Braxton .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000013GH	4	If you want an album to share with your love one ? <sssss> , well here it is , Secrets by Miss Braxton is one of the sexiest album ever ! <sssss> , if you do n't believe please listen to this sensual tracks " You 're Making Me High " & " Talking In His Sleep " , in this tracks Toni invites you to take a further step on love , and make it enjoyable ... wow , one of the things that Secrets offers their fan followers is bittersweet ballads that sound timeless like " Un-Break My Heart " no wonder that song spent 11 weeks on the number 1 spot back in 1996 . <sssss> The R&B area is not forgotten here " I Love Me Some Him " , what a song , this album covers love at the maximum , why the rate is not 5 stars , well there are some cuts that I personally do n't like , " How Could An Angel Break My Heart " ? <sssss> wich even though I ditch , was an international hit . <sssss> This is a total classic album , sadly the cover is poorly well done .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B0000013GH	3	Following the huge ( and well-deserved ) success of her debut , Toni Braxton unleashes " Secrets " , an album that follows the formula of its predecessor so slavishly that it takes almost no risks . <sssss> Not that the material here is bad ; in fact , quite a lot of it works . <sssss> But the album ultimately fails to take Braxton to another level with respect to songwriting and vocals . <sssss> " There 's No Me Without You " , a Babyface-penned number , is " Breathe Again 2 " . <sssss> Same song , different words . <sssss> And the sappy " How Can An Angel Break My Heart " , replete with sax by the ever-boring Kenny G , is near-unlistenable . <sssss> Ironically , the strongest cuts on " Secrets " are songs not produced by Babyface . <sssss> " Unbreak My Heart " is a soaring ballad that 's so well sung , you almost forget that it was written by schlockmeister Dianne Warren . <sssss> And R. Kelly gives Ms. Braxton a little edge in the ballad " I Do n't Want To " . <sssss> Ultimately , the verdict on " Secrets " is a split decision . <sssss> It 's absolutely nowhere near a disaster , but it 's not the great sophomore outing it could have been .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B0000013GH	5	From the cool way she sings the word ' find ' on the opener " Come On Over Here " to the percussive , bass-heavy track produced by Tony Rich , " Secrets " is an extraordinary piece of ordinary music . <sssss> While there is nothing especially innovative about it , Toni 's second LP is a pleasure from start to finish ( save for the horrendous " How Could An Angel Break My Heart " bleccchh !! <sssss> ) and it features one of my favorite Braxton tunes , the half sung / half spoken " Talking In His Sleep " a seductive , percolating jam that features some of her best vocals ever and a brilliantly minimalist track with live drums , keyboards and some wicked wah-wah guitar on the final chorus . <sssss> " Secrets " is Toni Braxton 's finest hour and a testament to the quality pouring out of LaFace Records in the mid 90 's .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B000001EW3	4	Personally , I never could stand country . <sssss> I 'm amazed that I even like this . <sssss> This CD contains some of '98 and ' 99 's best songs such as " From This Moment " , " You 're Still the One " , and the beautiful " You 've Got a Way " . <sssss> It 's one of the best-selling CDs by a female artist of all time so do n't miss out !
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000001EW3	1	Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion . <sssss> Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard , especially in the genre of country / pop . <sssss> Her voice is completely unoriginal , there 's no fire , range , or accessiblility . <sssss> I ca n't believe how truly awful her songwriting is ! <sssss> Terrible cliches , junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies . <sssss> Songs like That Do n't Impress Me Much , Man I Feel Like a Woman ! <sssss> , Do n't Be Stupid , and You 're Still the One just gives me the willies . <sssss> The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You 've Got a Way . <sssss> Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s . <sssss> Stay clear from this over-rated mess !
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B000001EW3	4	Shania Twain 's journey to superstardom starts with her third album COME ON OVER . <sssss> Like Kenny Rogers and the late Eddie Rabbitt , she went pop here . <sssss> This album opens with MAN ! <sssss> I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN which Shania considers her personal anthem for her female fans . <sssss> I love IF YOU WAN NA TOUCH HER , ASK ! <sssss> , THAT DO N'T IMPRESS ME MUCH and the love ballads FROM THIS MOMENT ON and YOU 'RE STILL THE ONE . <sssss> Shania performed YOU 'RE STILL THE ONE at a televised concert in Miami as a duet with Elton John . <sssss> Another duet they both did was Elton 's SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT . <sssss> With this album , Shania became popular in nightclubs . <sssss> The same thing would happen shortly later with Faith Hill 's BREATHE . <sssss> This woman is so damn beautiful . <sssss> She is so sexy also . <sssss> The kind of woman that Howard Stern would call a " piece of ass " .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B000001EW3	4	I just bought he International Version of Come On Over . <sssss> Many of the singles we 've heard on pop radio with these remixes . <sssss> They are well done and lend well to pop . <sssss> In some cases the mixes are even better then the original country ones . <sssss> Some highlights include You 're Still The One , You 've Got A Way , Love Gets Me Every Time , If You Wan na Touch Her Ask , etc etc . <sssss> Oh by the way to the reviewer who defended Shania by comparing her to Dolly . <sssss> Dont even bother . <sssss> The reason Dolly was successful in pop crossover is because in whatever she crossed over to , it still had its country roots , and they didnt remix the song for pop , it just stayed the same version on all formats . <sssss> Shania is great , but she releases different versions to different formats .
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B000001EW3	5	This is the more ' country ' of the two versions of this album . <sssss> If you want the ' dance ' one , then get the International version , also available from Amazon . <sssss> A lot of people , reviewers included , like to pick Shania apart , labelling her as this or that . <sssss> Country , pop or whatever . <sssss> Why some people ca n't just enjoy music for what it is without labelling it , I do n't know . <sssss> Who cares whether it 's country , pop , or both . <sssss> It 's fun , enjoyable music , 16 songs in all , and nearly all of them have been played on the radio ... there 's not too many albums that can boast of that . <sssss> The only song I do n't like much is " That do n't impress me much " . <sssss> But out of 16 songs , to dislike just one , is n't too bad . <sssss> So if you like catchy , singable , fun , melodic songs , regardless of genre , I 'm sure you will like this album too .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000001EW3	4	I 'll bet they did n't plan on this out-selling " The Eagles " and " Michael Jackson " , but it has . <sssss> With the pop-country formula perfected on this , they found 34 million people who wanted it . <sssss> This is practically half hits . <sssss> It includes " Man , I Feel Like A Woman " , " From This Moment On " , " You 're Still The One " , and " Honey , I 'm Home " . <sssss> And as far as the video for " That Do n't Impress Me Much " goes , Ouch ! <sssss> Very few women can look that good . <sssss> But besides the beauty , I do think she has talent , and a great voice . <sssss> Overall , it 's a great album by the queen of pop-country .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000001EW3	4	This was a truly groundbreaking album for Shania . <sssss> While her previous album THE WOMAN IN ME made her a superstar in country music , this album pushed her far into the pop realm , making her a major superstar . <sssss> A generous amount of singles were released from the album , around 12 or so of the 16 tracks were singles . <sssss> The album was even repackaged with pop remixes for the International market and pop fans . <sssss> Overexposure ? <sssss> Sure . <sssss> But the music is n't all bad . <sssss> There 's some great ballads here like " I Wo n't Leave You Lonely " , " From This Moment On " , " You 're Still The One " , " You 've Got A Way " , and more . <sssss> The uptempo songs are fun and became signature songs . <sssss> If you mention Shania to someone and they might break out in singing " Man ! I Feel Like A Woman " ! <sssss> or " That Do n't Impress Me Much " . <sssss> The album had a long shelf life , and sold millions upon millions worldwide , one of the biggest selling albums of all time . <sssss> Some of my favorites include " Love Gets Me Every Time " , " From This Moment On " , " Whatever You Do , Do n't " ! <sssss> , " Holding Onto Love " and more . <sssss> It 's a decent cd , not the best but definately a fun cd to listen to .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B000001EW3	5	The success of this album was and still is incredible . <sssss> With sells up to 20 million , Grammys and hit singles . <sssss> It all started with the ballad " You 're still the one " which was the first single and thanks to it , Shania started to be known in new territories with her music and not by name . <sssss> " Come on over " goes from the # 1 hit " You 're still the one " to the Revlon 's TV music spot with Shania 's " Man ! I feel like a woman " . <sssss> Then to the theme of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant 's " Notting Hill " and other hits like " When " , " From this moment on " and " That do n't impress me much " . <sssss> Shania 's music is a mix of country music and pop . <sssss> Commercially is qualified as country but it has a big pop influence . <sssss> This album is very good , it 's fresh and fun .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000001EW3	3	After a whirlwind of success with THE WOMAN IN ME , Shania returned in late 1997 with her follow up , COME ON OVER . <sssss> COME ON OVER is much more easily accessible by those who were lukewarm to her more country albums before , which is nice , but however there are many things about this album which leave a bad taste in my mouth . <sssss> Yes the songs are extremely catchy and make you smile , make you want to sing along , all those things . <sssss> However , lyrically this album is very disapointing . <sssss> Not in comparison to THE WOMAN IN ME , but in general they are very immature lyrics in many areas , and for that reason the album is very patchy and not very creative . <sssss> Songs filled with cliches and catchy phrases make this a very accessible album , not to mention her marketing of the album to a pop crowd with this country version ( which is still very pop country ) and the release of the International Version of this cd in 1999 , which was the songs remixed to suit a more pop radio market . <sssss> I have nothing against pop country music , however it just seems she sacrificed her image in favor to sell more records , and this album has sold close to 20 million worldwide . <sssss> Some songs which just seem childish and boring to me , like " When " , " Do n't Be Stupid " , " Come On Over " , " Whatever You Do ! Do n't " ! <sssss> , " If You Wan na Touch Her Ask " ! <sssss> , among a few , however there are a few gems in here such as " Man ! I Feel Like A Woman " , " Love Gets Me Every Time " , " You 've Got A Way " , " You 're Still The One " , " Black Eyes Blue Tears " , and " From This Moment On " ( although the solo version is far and beyond better than the duet with Bryan White ) . <sssss> Overall its a catchy album , but artistically is is quite disapointing .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B000001EW3	3	It is true that Shania Twain is the most over-rated singer of the 90s . <sssss> And it 's true , if it was n't for her husband we would have never heard of her . <sssss> And it 's true , she has greatly benefited from heavy promotion and her belly button . <sssss> And it 's true , SHE IS NOT A COUNTRY SINGER ! <sssss> However , I ca n't help but to like this album . <sssss> Despite the fact its corny and cheesey , it 's still funny . <sssss> Let 's hope when she returns from vacation , this almost 40-something new mother will have something to say and not write lyrics like she 's still in high school .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000001EW3	1	what is so special about Shania Twain ? <sssss> she is a country Jennifer Lopez . <sssss> all hype and no talent . <sssss> Lee ann Rimes is a better vocalist but when she tried to go pop all Hell broke out . <sssss> Shania is pop . <sssss> her songs and material have more in common with celine dion than Patsy Cline . <sssss> that do n't impress me much is as pop as addicted to Love . <sssss> she is great at marketing but her music has no roots . <sssss> Still the one was catchy as is the case with some of her other material but considering her overall impact she is way overrated & overplayed .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B000001EW3	5	What an album . <sssss> I am still shocked that she was able to create a 16 set album with little to no fillers . <sssss> The only songs that were n't to my taste ( not calling them bad ) were " I 'm Holdin ' On To Love " " Rock This Country " and " Black Eyes , Blue Tears " . <sssss> This album deserved the attention and sales , and is a modern day masterpiece of pop culture .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B000001EW3	5	" Come on Over " , should be consider the biggest crossover album of country goin ' to mainstream . <sssss> This album has nothing bad , every track is worth listen , not a skipping songs record . <sssss> This album is for anyone in love or in a mood of party stomping tracks . <sssss> The whole album reserves the title of great mixture of country-ballads-pop anthemic music . <sssss> This made Shania an ICON and of course is the best selling album by a female in the whole history of the USA , over 19 million copies sold , talk about numbers ?
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000001EW3	3	If you 're looking for a crowd-pleaser of an album that wo n't challenge the ears , Shania 's gazillion-seller " Come On Over " will suit you well . <sssss> It 's a collection of crafted pop tunes with a slight country twang courtesy of producer / husband " Mutt " Lange ( AC / DC , Def Leppard ) . <sssss> " You 're Still the One " , " From This Moment On " , and the catchy " That Do n't Impress Me Much " are all agreeable ditties that have found a welcome home on radio . <sssss> There are better pop records than this , but there are also twice as many that are worse . <sssss> " Come On Over " does the job as a record that aims to please and nothing more .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B000001EW3	5	To start off , if I could give this album 5 1 / 2 stars or even 6 stars I would , I have listened to this album front to back so many times , know EVERY word to this album , NEVER get sick of this album , this 16 tracks flow so good together , it is INCREDIBLE ! <sssss> to note that every song was written by Shania and Mutt Lange that these song are masterpieces , not only did the album release 12 ( un-heard-of ) songs , sells almost 19 million copies , spend 3 years on the album chart , and give us songs like " Man ! I Feel Like A Woman " ! <sssss> and " You 're Still The One " it 's probably one of my Top 10 CD 's in my collection . <sssss> This album out does every count CD imaginable . <sssss> Shania you RULE !
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B0000025F7	4	November 6th , 2010 . <sssss> This is one groovy album . <sssss> It 's the first album by Michael that I 've listened to entirely and liked most of the songs ( my other full listen was to 2001 ' sInvinciblewhich had a few songs that were noteworthy , but not like this ) . <sssss> There are obviously 19 " tracks " here but some of them are just commentaries about Michael , a bit on how he was and his approach to his songs and such ( which I found interesting and still do when listening ) or original demos of songs ( of which one I liked and one I disliked ) . <sssss> Like I said , it is a very smooth , dance-enabling album full of songs that for the most part have similar tempos but are still almost always well-crafted . <sssss> I actually felt spoiled listening to the set over and over . <sssss> The filler tracks are kept to a minimum . <sssss> " It 's The Falling In Love " Feat . <sssss> Patti Austin is pleasant , although not the best track . <sssss> " Burn This Disco Out " , the final track on the vinyl version of this album has a nice beat , but also could be stronger . <sssss> They also put these two tracks right after another which does n't help . <sssss> But I do n't hate these tracks . <sssss> I just do n't particularly love them and find them filler more than anything . <sssss> The last of the MOR tracks are " Workin ' Day And Night ( The Original demo ) " . <sssss> Thankfully it 's not really meant to be an album track but a space filler or an extra . <sssss> Other than that , this is quite a strong offering from Michael and marked his first effort on the Epic label .4.25 stars or an 8.5 / 10 . <sssss> DOWNLOAD : " I Ca n't Help It " " Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough " " Rock With You " & the underrated " Girlfriend "
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B0000025F7	5	Before this album , Michael Jackson had minor success as a solo artist . <sssss> He enjoyed abundant success with his brothers as the Jackson Five and later , the Jacksons . <sssss> Since the Jacksons were dropped from the Motown label and had signed with Epic , MJ stuck with this label to this day . <sssss> On the cover , MJ sports a tuxedo , leaning against a brick wall . <sssss> DO N'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH debuted on the radio in July 1979 . <sssss> MJ wore the tuxedo in the music video also . <sssss> In addition to that song , hits that appeared on 1995 's HISTORY are ROCK WITH YOU and SHE 'S OUT OF MY LIFE . <sssss> The title track should have been on HISTORY also . <sssss> I also like WORKING DAY AND NIGHT and Paul McCartney 's GIRLFRIEND . <sssss> Later , ex-Beatle McCartney would join forces with MJ for THE GIRL IS MINE and SAY SAY SAY . <sssss> This album is a Quincy Jones production and the more successful follow-up THRILLER would be also . <sssss> Back in ' 79 , MJ was n't yet the King Of Pop and one of the biggest-selling pop / rock artists . <sssss> The other songs are incredible .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B0000025F7	5	Off The Wall being Jacksons 5th studio album and 1979 release and was a major hit amongst the critics and was a massive hit in the UK , Australia and France to mention a few . <sssss> The sound of " Off The Wall " is a mix of disco , pop and R&B . <sssss> Allmusic , Q and Blender all gave it 5/5 . <sssss> The album has many hits including " Do n't stop till you get enough " , " Rock with you " , " She 's out of my life " " Of the wall " and " Girlfriend " . <sssss> In my opinion this release is just as good as his masterwork Thriller . <sssss> This special edition also contains demo versions of " Do n't stop till you get enough " " Workin ' Day and Night " . <sssss> It also contains interviews with producer Quincy Jones and Songwriter Rod Temperton discussing the maing of the album " Off The Wall " . <sssss> 5/5 .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B0000025F7	4	This album was released 11 years before me . <sssss> It was around the disco era ( I think ) and this album was ( I think ) pretty modern for 1979 . <sssss> It is very different to any of MJ 's other albums one album I think relates to it a bit is " Thriller " fom then , his work never sounded like this . <sssss> This a very soulful album with classics like " Do n't Stop Til ' You Get Enough " and " Rock With You " I find it a good album , See I was brought up with " Bad " And " Dangerous " so anything before that is very very strange . <sssss> But I like this album The songs are great and I will always love this .
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B0000025F7	5	It 's hard to believe with the benefit of afterthought that Michael Jackson 's solo career took such a long time to take off , namely a good part of a decade . <sssss> But when it did , it rose into unprecedented heights both commercially and artistically . <sssss> Jackson at this point had not yet evolved into the strange , shrieking vocal imp of his post-Bad era , and his singing on this record is remarkable , a sexy yet wholesome , soulful yet understated delivery capable of many shadings . <sssss> The falsetto of " Do n't Stop 'til You Get Enough " is almost like Prince ; " Off the Wall " 's brooding beat is irresistible ; " Rock with You " is dreamily romantic and gorgeously sung ; and " Working Day and Night " is a breathless rush , classic dance music . <sssss> Then there 's the celebrated balladeering of " She 's Out of My Life " , which remains one of Jackson 's best ballads to this date , a mode that he lost touch with starting with Dangerous . <sssss> Michael Jackson may be behind the times now , but back in 1979 , he was way ahead .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B0000025F7	5	Michael Jackson 's first solo studio album Off The Wall is arguably his best album . <sssss> This album contains many of his hits such as Do n't Stop Til You Get Enough , ( the song which Chris Tucker performs in Rush Hour 2 --- The man destroying a classic ! <sssss> ) , Rock With You , Off The Wall , Working Day & Night , Girlfriend . <sssss> The lp is short and to the point . <sssss> Very sweet and legendary . <sssss> Rock With You is also my all-time favorite Michael Jackson song so this album is extra special . <sssss> This album is a little more midtempo to ballad type songs and less upbeat than Thriller but if you like Michael Jackson you will surely enjoy it . <sssss> If you do n't have this album I suggest you buy it quickly .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B0000025F7	5	As the lead singer of the Jackson 5 , Michael Jackson had already been labeled a legend at a young age ; but OFF THE WALL introduced the world to the adult Michael Jackson , and proved that he was still very much worthy of that label . <sssss> It was the real beginning for Michael as a solo artist , and opened the doors for his next album THRILLER , which would become the greatest selling album of all time and help foist upon a Jackson a new title : King Of Pop . <sssss> Under the supervision of Quincy Jones , OFF THE WALL illustrated some of Jackson 's most soulful material . <sssss> The title-track is among the album 's smoothest , and introduces his silky feel for the dance-floor . <sssss> The lively " Working Day And Night " was a teaser for the singles " Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough " and " Rock With You " , both of which reached # 1 on the pop charts . <sssss> Slowing down the pace , the album also hosted some romantic tunes which , through the years , have become classics in their own right . <sssss> With " Girlfriend " and " She 's Out Of My Life " , Michael proved that he never lost his golden touch when it came to love songs . <sssss> Other highlights include the soulful " I Ca n't Help It " . <sssss> This version contains bonus material , such as demo versions of " Dont Stop Til You Get Enough " , and interviews , and bonus tracks . <sssss> This is clearly one of his best albums , making it essential for your collection . <sssss> OFF THE WALL provides a unique sound , and its still ahead of its time even more than 20 years later .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B0000025F7	5	... awful cover on this special edition . <sssss> Buyers realize that record companies do want to make visible distinctions between original releases and re-mastered editions , but to make as drastic a change as this one borders on sacrilege . <sssss> The original back cover is a shot of Jackson sporting a modest Afro , a killer smile , and the nose that he was born with . <sssss> This special edition has a photo that comes closer to being the Michael from the " Thriller " days , a few years from " Off the Wall " . <sssss> The Epic record executive that authorized this " travesty " should be severely reprimanded . <sssss> That said , " Off the Wall " is a more consistent album than its successor , the mega-selling " Thriller " . <sssss> Besides the chart-toppers ( " Rock with You " , " Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough " , and " She 's Out of My Life " ) , the " B-sides " are A1 ! <sssss> " Workin ' Day and Night " , " Get on the Floor " , the title cut , and the Stevie Wonder-influenced " I Ca n't Help It " are as vibrant today as they were over a quarter century ago . <sssss> The bonus features on this edition can be , for the most part , avoided . <sssss> Anyway , it is the music that counts and it 's here in spades .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B0000025F7	5	This is def . <sssss> my favorite album from Michael jackson . <sssss> Off the Wall is cool . <sssss> Do n't stop till you get enough is one of my favorite Mj songs ! <sssss> Rock with you is an excellent dance track . <sssss> Burn this disco out is interesting . <sssss> I think this a great example of disco funk , and it was made during that time . <sssss> So anybody who 's a fan of funk / r & b is def . <sssss> gon na love this cd . <sssss> This def . <sssss> one of the best albums made of all time . <sssss> His video and image for this album is really simple by today 's standards , but is great in some ways because it does n't outdate itself . <sssss> The videos are pretty cool as well . <sssss> Go out and buy it ! <sssss> This CD is awesome .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B0000025F7	5	This is Michael 's first hit album . <sssss> I love the classic hits " Rock With You " , " She 's Out Of My Life " and the title track . <sssss> I also like " Do n't Stop Till You Get Enough " , " Get On the Floor " and " Workin Day and Night " . <sssss> " Burn This Disco Out " is not considered a hit song , but it is a groovy jam to me . <sssss> " Girlfriend " is a smooth cut . <sssss> I really like this song . <sssss> The music on this album is timeless .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B0000025F7	5	When Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones teamed up to record the 1979 album " Off the Wall " , I doubt they knew what kind of beast they were about to create . <sssss> Spawning four Top Ten singles including two Number Ones , " Off the Wall " blasted into the Top Ten and gave Jackson his biggest solo success at the time . <sssss> But chart domination aside , the album is a classic collection of funk and disco-laced soul that holds up amazing well today . <sssss> His magical voice breathed life into infectious hits like " Do n't Stop til You Get Enough " and " Rock With You " . <sssss> He also cruises effortlessly through the hyperactive " Working Day and Night " and the blazing title track . <sssss> But Jackson , I think , triumphs best on " She 's Out of My Life " . <sssss> If tossed into the hands of a lesser singer , this song would have been a disastrous sapfest of maple syrup sentiment , but it 's Jackson 's delivery that makes this song a genuine " she-just-dumped-me " ballad . <sssss> Three years later , he would return to the scene with a little album called " Thriller " which sold , oh , maybe a few million copies worldwide . <sssss> But " Off the Wall " should be credited as the album that put Michael on the map as an adult solo star , and it holds up as a verified classic .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B0000025RI	4	Right now , I feel sorry for MJ being put all these charges against him , people should give him credit like for this , The Largest Selling Album Of All Time ... " Thiller " . <sssss> Though several things knock this review a star down . <sssss> Though I 'm reviewing the special edition , the original album has only 9 tracks . <sssss> and " The Lady In My Life " is the weakest track . <sssss> This album has alot of highlights like " Billie Jean " , " Beat It " , and " Wan na Be Startin ' Somethin' " . <sssss> This album is well put together . <sssss> Please note : This Is MJ 's last album in this type of sound . <sssss> This is the album that made him a household name bad or good . <sssss> If you are collecting MJ stuff this is ONE ALBUM YOU SHOULD DEFINITLEY NOT FORGET .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B0000025RI	5	I sense a legend in the making on this one , folks . <sssss> If this young and talented kid can keep his head on straight , I predict big , big things for him . <sssss> " Thriller " is a 9-song masterpiece - I only wish it were longer . <sssss> This man Michael Jackson is without equal in the show business world , a living , breathing sensation ! <sssss> Ever seen him dance ? <sssss> He does a " moon walk " number that 's guaranteed to floor ya ' !! <sssss> And his singing ? <sssss> Forgetaboutit !! <sssss> His vocal range and depth on each gleeful note will get you dancing yourself - although not nearly as great as Michael Jackson himself ! <sssss> " Billy Jean " will enrapture you ; " Thriller " ( especially the video ) will scare you ; " Beat It " will make you groove on your living room floor ; and " Human Nature " will catch you singing in the shower . <sssss> Trust me folks , if this guy does n't turn to drugs , drink , women or any other hurtful vice , he 's going to go far in the music world . <sssss> As long as he stays down to earth , I think he 'll be just fine . <sssss> A REAL SENSATION , THIS ONE ! 
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B0000025RI	5	This whole album belongs in the songwriter 's hall of fame . <sssss> Everything on Thriller has a timeless quality to it , even independent of the sales records that the album shattered and the mania of Jackson 's persona and performances . <sssss> " Beat It " and " Billie Jean " were both nominated for Song of the Year at the Grammys that year , and they actually deserve the honour . <sssss> Michael Jackson has always been an underrated lyricist ( his schmaltzy feel-good , " Heal the World " songs aside ) with a gift for rhyme and turns of phrase , and " Billie Jean " is one of his best . <sssss> For years I did n't even know what exactly he was singing about , but the way he sang those lyrics made the sentiments abundantly clear . <sssss> And when I deciphered them the lyrics leapt out : " She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene ... " And " Beat It " would be a great song even if it did n't have the distinction of bridging soul and rock and breaking the racial barrier at radio and MTV -- its thunderous chorus and instant-classic guitar riff ( courtesy of Toto 's Steve Lukather , who 's always heinously overlooked in favour of the Eddie Van Halen solo ) mesh perfectly with Jackson 's larger-than-life persona to make the ultimate defiance anthem . <sssss> " Thriller " , written by Rod Temperton , is a marvellously constructed song rich in instrumental detail ( Quincy Jones was pretty sharp back then ) , " Human Nature " is a lovely haze , " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " is mindless fun at its best , " Wan na Be Startin ' Somethin' " is the funkiest song in the Jackson pantheon , and even the somewhat silly Paul McCartney duet " The Girl Is Mine " sounds good in the context of an album that offers such a good time . <sssss> The Eagles may have broken Jackson 's U.S. sales record , but Thriller remains the original blockbuster album . <sssss> And a monolith in music history , even if you consider just artistic merit .
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B0000025RI	5	This album is the greatest-selling album of all time , and with good reason . <sssss> But just because it has sold upwards of 40 million copies , does n't necessarily mean that it is the greatest album of all time . <sssss> But it still deserves 5 stars , and it probably is the greatest in its genre . <sssss> This is an album that appealed ( and still does ) to all ages . <sssss> From its up-tempo dance tracks to the ballads to the epic title track , this album is truly timeless , and it would be nice to see it remastered with maybe some bonus tracks . <sssss> I , for one , would buy the new copy . <sssss> Booklet includes all lyrics .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B0000025RI	5	What more can be said about this album ? <sssss> Every song is worth hearing so many times that it 's just nearly impossible to get tired of it . <sssss> SEVEN of its 9 songs charted at number 10 or better , and even " Baby Be Mine " was getting a fair amount of airplay well over a year after the album was released . <sssss> Personally , though , my favorite song from the album is " PYT " even though songs like " Billie Jean " and " Beat It " were more successful . <sssss> Even if he comes to be regarded as the strangest person ever to walk the earth , this album should still be treated like royalty .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B0000025RI	5	I 'm not the biggest Michael Jackson fan , not even close . <sssss> I do n't even listen to pop that much . <sssss> But whenever I put this album on once or twice a year , it still blows me away . <sssss> I can see why people continuously view it as a mark of excellence . <sssss> It 's like nothing but singles . <sssss> Technically it 's only half singles , but you know what I mean . <sssss> One of the truly flawless albums front-to-back in music history . <sssss> Quincy Jones did a perfect job producing . <sssss> Great track sequencing too . <sssss> I mean 5 seconds into the album you 've just got to move . <sssss> If I made a cd of best dancefloor songs of all-time it would begin with " Wan na Be Startin ' Something " . <sssss> Thriller is without question an album that deserves every award and praise it gets . <sssss> I 've got it on cassette , CD and vinyl . <sssss> It 's in a league by itself . <sssss> Only George Michael 's Faith album comes close .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B0000025RI	5	This cd sure does n't need any introduction . <sssss> However , of the 5 full length studio albums by Michael , Thriller is the one to start with . <sssss> Why ? <sssss> For starters , Off The Wall sounds terribly dated now and does n't have a solid compilation of songs . <sssss> Bad was quite good , but you could get that after you get Thriller . <sssss> Dangerous was only okay -- at 14 tracks there were some very repetitive sounds and the disc was very long -- overly long . <sssss> What about HIStory ? <sssss> The hits disc was missing key tracks and the new disc was , again , way too long at 15 tracks , and not all of the tracks were superior . <sssss> So , it is Thriller you should buy first . <sssss> Not only is it the biggest selling album in history , 7 of the 9 tracks were hits . <sssss> Remember the days when an artist would have at least 5 songs of one album -- not like many of today 's one-hit-wonderfuls . <sssss> I do n't even need to defend this cd , everyone knows it 's great . <sssss> Does is sound dated ? <sssss> Well , yes , it 's 18 years old now and Michael set a trend in music back then that is no longer " happening " with today 's music , though you can hear echoes of it . <sssss> This cd is a must for any serious music fan .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B0000025RI	5	THRILLER became the most successful album in history , selling over 50 million worldwide . <sssss> And its easy to see why . <sssss> Michael Jackson is simply good at what he does . <sssss> The music is irresistible , you ca n't help but dance or sing along . <sssss> The music is original , like no other music out there . <sssss> He paved the way for many artists , and its easy to see why people call him a legend , because he is . <sssss> THRILLER is one of his shining moments in his career , and it proved to be a huge success for him . <sssss> The " Thriller " short film became famous for its screenplay and film work , and rightfully so , the choreography was excellent and like nothing else . <sssss> Other big hits from this album include " Beat It " , " Billie Jean " , " The Girl Is Mine " ( with Paul McCartney ) , " Wan na Be Startin ' Something " , and more . <sssss> This version comes with bonus tracks , demo versions , and a lot of interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton . <sssss> This is a must have , if you do n't have it or want to revisit the magic , this one 's a good one to buy .
A5889INEGKCQY	B0000025RI	3	This album is pretty good . <sssss> It contains a lot of good dance and pop music and many tracks on this album became classic such as Billie Jean , Beat It and many moore . <sssss> The production is also good which is one of the key element to the albums sucess not to mention the style and mind of Michael Jackson which after this album suffered something that I do n't know what is but i think it 's serious . <sssss> Though I Have said good things about Thriller many people may think it 's weird that I gave it just three stars . <sssss> Well the song The Girl Is Mine is not a very good song . <sssss> That 's the worst song on the album and there is some flaws with some of the songs on it . <sssss> I also think that Thriller is a bit overrated I think it 's no wonder it so so many copies but I Do not think it 's deserve to be called a masterpiece because there is something on this album that is missing and I do n't know what it is but I sure notice that when I have listened to it as a whole .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B0000025RI	5	... there was a guy by the name of Michael Jackson that followed under the guidance of a genius named Quincy Jones , the man that made hits for everybody that was anybody in the music biz . <sssss> Well , Jones 's directorship led to Mr. Jackson taking home a boatload of Grammy awards for an album that yielded hit after hit on the charts ... so many that they have become the stuff of legend . <sssss> Even though , Jackson has gotten his share of bad press for almost two decades , subsequently starting after this album 's release , " Thriller " still ranks as one of the major releases in popular music history . <sssss> That fact can not be diminished by the singer 's personal perks and proclivities . <sssss> The " special edition " only really offers one worthwhile bonus : Vincent Price 's missing " third verse " to the title cut . <sssss> Makes one long for its addition to the album cut , adding another dimension to an already near-perfect blending of sight and sound in the form of the landmark music video .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B0000025RI	5	Ok , so I reviewed this album a while back , and decided on reviewing this album again . <sssss> After hearing about the recent death of Michael Jackson . <sssss> After he died , I decided to listen to all of his albums , and I found this album to be excellent , but not my favorite from him . <sssss> Most of the songs are way too over played , and there 's two or three other albums that I could suggest that sound just as good as this one ! <sssss> ( ex . <sssss> buy donna summer 's self titled 82 cd , or Aretha 's Jump to it album , did i forget to mention Prince and Teena Marie ? <sssss> ) I think the real credit goes to Quincy Jones , he was a master a producing this album . <sssss> I do like Beat it , P.Y.T. <sssss> , Billie Jean , and Human Nature ( although i do prefer the SWV version ) . <sssss> I think most of the songs could be seen as good for its time , but I do think that he 's came out with better stuff then this . <sssss> Some of his older albums are good , and I like Bad , Dangerous , Blood on the Dance floor alittle better . <sssss> Billie Jean is my favorite Michael Jackson song . <sssss> I heard this song my freshman year in HS , and thought it was dark , chilling , yet stood the test of time because it still sounds decent even by today 's standards . <sssss> I think the last few tracks are the ones that I would almost consider hidden , but it def . <sssss> shows how much of an R&B album this still was . <sssss> I think this album is enjoyable , but def . <sssss> not the best pop album of all time .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B0000025RI	5	This great re-release is worth owning for the bonus material alone . <sssss> While the LP itself hardly needed remastering ( technically " Thriller " has always been one of the most impeccably produced albums ever released ) the new clarity on these tracks will amaze even the most jaded listener . <sssss> The crown jewel here is the voice-over session with the late , great Vincent Price , his ' rap ' at the end of the title track and the newly restored second verse are a true revelation ! <sssss> A Classic made even better !
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B00000269M	5	BAD , Michael Jackson 's third solo album on the Epic label , spawned seven Top 20 hits as did its predecessor THRILLER . <sssss> The hits include the title track , which " Weird Al " Yankovic would later use the music for his parody FAT . <sssss> THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL kicks butt . <sssss> ANOTHER PART OF ME is cool also . <sssss> MAN IN THE MIRROR tells about children , naked , hungry and penniless . <sssss> I JUST CA N'T STOP LOVING YOU is a duet between Jackson and Siedah Garrett . <sssss> DIRTY DIANA is about an aspiring actress and / or singer . <sssss> SMOOTH CRIMINAL sounds awesome . <sssss> Except DIRTY DIANA , SMOOTH CRIMINAL and ANOTHER PART OF ME , the aforementioned songs would later appear on HISTORY BOOK I , PAST , PRESENT and FUTURE . <sssss> JUST GOOD FRIENDS is a duet between Jackson and Stevie Wonder . <sssss> In 1987 , when this album was released , Wonder released an album the same year with another Jackson-Wonder duet . <sssss> LEAVE ME ALONE is a bonus track , unavailable on the defunct LP . <sssss> When Yankovic released his EVEN WORSE album in 1988 , he did a parody of this album cover with the very same art conception .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B00000269M	5	This album was in , singles wise more sucessful than " Thriller " Spawning 5 # 1 Singles all of them released in a row ! <sssss> and got 8 top 10 singles . <sssss> But , in sales wise , it didnt sell half of what " Thriller " sold . <sssss> This album is a great album . <sssss> In the Late ' 80 's I think people were way into POP and not the " Thriller " type of music . <sssss> So he made a good move , But hard-out fans of " Off The Wall " and " Thriller " abandoned his music because of this album . <sssss> This brang him alot of success though just one , 1 in 12 people in the U.K own " Bad " ! <sssss> The songs released were by far the best of the album . <sssss> these are the singles that went to # 1 : I Just Can Stop Loving You - # 1 ! <sssss> Bad - # 1 ! <sssss> The Way You Make Me Feel - # 1 ! <sssss> Man In The Mirror - # 1 ! <sssss> Dirty Diana - # 1 ! <sssss> So this was a push up for success , though it rarely happens his next album sone something that most artists cant do these days .....
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00000269M	5	By the time Michael Jackson 's album titled Bad was released , there was enough scrutiny from the press against him , and it was just the beginning as we know what all the scrutiny lead to in 1993 . <sssss> With all this new speculation of him being a weird person around 1987 , more attention was paid to him , than to his music . <sssss> So much of this album was overlooked , a mistake on those who did so . <sssss> Bad became the second best selling album of all time , clocking at 37 million ( close behind the # 1 selling album of all time , 1982 's Thriller at close to 50 million ) . <sssss> The album spawned many many hit singles such as the title track , The Way You Make Me Feel , Liberian Girl , Man In The Mirror , I Just Cant Stop Loving You , Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal . <sssss> The CD version of Bad contains an extra track titled Leave Me Alone , a message for the press . <sssss> Quincy Jones and Michael worked their magic again with this album , it is so easy to listen to and dance along with the music . <sssss> Forget what the press said , because truly in his music is the message , and the music is all that matters .
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B00000269M	4	Michael Jackson maybe one of the weirdest stars in music , he wears makeup , he has ruined his looks by countless botched up plastic surgery jobs and somehow , he has even managed to change his skin colour . <sssss> But , all that aside , he has made some of the most memorable pop and dance music ever , and this album just goes to prove that you can not judge music by the ' cover ' . <sssss> Greatly overshadowed by various scandals and tabloid stories , Michael 's music became secondary and some people even refused to buy his records because of that . <sssss> And that 's too bad , because what you have on this album are well produced , well performed dance / pop songs , one a duet with Stevie Wonder . <sssss> 16 page booklet includes lyrics and photos .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00000269M	5	How do you follow up the success of one of the best albums of all times ( THRILLER ) ? <sssss> Well BAD is a good place to start . <sssss> Released 5 years after THRILLER , BAD was quite the contrary to the album , its quite good actually . <sssss> BAD proves to move Michael further into music , expanding his roots a little and trying new things , and he does it well . <sssss> BAD does not try to be THRILLER , just like how none of his albums are like each other , they are all distinct and different from each other . <sssss> At this point in 1987 he was called the King of Pop , and rightfully so . <sssss> Big hits from this album include " Bad " , " I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You " , " The Way You Make Me Feel " , " Man In The Mirror " , " Smooth Criminal " and other hits include " Dirty Diana " , " Leave Me Alone " and more . <sssss> This is the Special Edition of BAD including many interviews with the likes of Quincy Jones , and as well some bonus unreleased tracks . <sssss> Well worth the money !
A5889INEGKCQY	B00000269M	3	Bad was released in 1987 almost 5 years after Thriller . <sssss> The LP contains some of his most famous songs and the front cover is a classic . <sssss> However the lP does not come as a perfect work . <sssss> I Liked most of the songs but I Did n't like Speed Demon , Just Good Friends , Another Part Of Me and Dirty Diana . <sssss> I thought these songs were fillers even though they were released as singels . <sssss> Every song of this album was released as a single and that 's maybe why the LP did not sell as much as Thriller . <sssss> Michael who though this would outsell his 50 million seller predicessor was wrong . <sssss> The Album however sold all over the world but not as much as Thriller especially in the US where his album sales declined with each release . <sssss> Bad contains however some [ good ] tracks such as Bad , The Way You Make Me Feel and more than are both enjoyable and danceable . <sssss> However I think more should be expected after more than 2 years of work . <sssss> The Material on Bad is also not like it was on Thriller . <sssss> The songs and the lyrics are more self-indulgient and it 's like he is somewhat corny or cheesy . <sssss> But Bad made big waves in 1987-1988 and it sold well around the world and brought Michael a whole new legion of fans that had not been listening to Thriller or too young to remember . <sssss> But also alienate a lot of fans of Thriller . <sssss> Overall allright album with good and bad songs that is worth listening to . <sssss> And By the way I do n't think Thriller is that great album and in my opinion his best album is Off The Wall which unfortunately was never followed up by another great album .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B00000269M	5	Michael Jackson had the insurmountable task of following up what was not only the biggest selling album of time , but a real cultural phenomenon . <sssss> Thriller was released in late 1982 and due to its success it took Mr. Jackson five years to release its follow-up . <sssss> While Bad obviously was not half as big as Thriller in terms of sales , it is still a great record . <sssss> The title track finds Mr. Jackson taking a defiant stance and instead of running away from trouble as he did in " Beat It " , he stakes it head-on . <sssss> " The Way You Make Me Feel " is a bright and sunny song that has an incredibly infectious groove . <sssss> " Just Good Friends " is a real treat as he duets with Stevie Wonder and you get to hear two masters at work . <sssss> " Man In the Mirror " is a spiritual song that begs one to look at themselves and see that we can all make a difference . <sssss> " I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You " is a good ballad that is a duet with Siediah Garrett , the songs writer . <sssss> It was original written to be sung with Whitney Houston , but when she was unavailable , Ms. Garrett stepped in and does a nice good . <sssss> " Dirty Diana " is a blazing rocker and " Leave Me Alone " is angry tirade against the circus atmosphere that his life had become due to the media . <sssss> " Smooth Criminal " is a pumping track that has vicious beat and tremendous vocal . <sssss> Bad does hold one record over Thriller , it became the first album to produce five number one singles ( " I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You " , " Bad " , " Dirty Diana " , " Man In the Mirror " & " The Way You Make Me Feel " ) .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B00000269M	3	Michael Jackson has truely always been a joke , when I 've been around . <sssss> Truthfully he 's never been popular since was a toddler and now im in college . <sssss> So im not a huge mega fan like some people . <sssss> ( actually care more for Jermaine and janet they produce really good soul music ) . <sssss> As for Bad , it 's got great pop beats , everybody heard the songs a million times , and he 's got a great message . <sssss> Dirty Diana definately an intersting song . <sssss> As for , the way you make me feel . <sssss> I think he was truely at his peak of normalness , while making this album . <sssss> How could you not like this music , it 's really good .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B00000269M	5	I remember buying this album in 1987 when I was sixteen . <sssss> I love this album . <sssss> My favorite track is " I Ca n't Stop Loving You " . <sssss> This is a beautiful duet with Siedah Garrett . <sssss> I also love " Dirty Diana " and " The Way You Make Me Feel " . <sssss> Another part Of Me and The Man In The Mirror and the title tracks are also monster hits off this album . <sssss> There are some lesser known songs on this album that I love . <sssss> " Speed Demon " has a great beat to it . <sssss> " Liberian Girl " is a smooth sexy cut . <sssss> " Just Good Friends " is an upbeat track . <sssss> " Leave Me Alone " is a personal song about Michael 's yearning for privacy . <sssss> This is a good tune . <sssss> This is an excellent album overall .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00000269M	3	Michael Jackson faced the most daunting task any recording artist could tackle : following up the greatest-selling album of all time . <sssss> " Bad " is an all-too-obvious example of what happens when you try too hard to top yourself . <sssss> His first album in 5 years , the CD has some really good songs sandwiched in between cheesy material . <sssss> There 's no denying the soul and power of " Man in the Mirror " , a far more convincing inspirational song than the bloated mess that is " Heal the World " . <sssss> The excellent " Smooth Criminal " radiates with unfiltered energy and urgency , while " The Way You Make Me Feel " is a bouncy , if fluffy , love song with a killer chorus . <sssss> Elsewhere , it 's a one-way trip to Velveeta-land . <sssss> Michael 's duet with Siedah Garret , " I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You " is so syrupy , it looks better on a mile-high stack of waffles . <sssss> The song is extremely sappy . <sssss> When he warned , " your butt is mine " on the tepid title track , I was holding back bursts of laughter . <sssss> C'mon , Jacko . <sssss> We know you as a lover , not a fighter . <sssss> You said it yourself . <sssss> And his duet with Stevie , " Just Good Friends " is just forgettable . <sssss> Had this CD been released by someone else , it would n't have debuted at No . <sssss> 1 and spawned five Number One singles as it did . <sssss> While I was n't looking for a sequel to " Thriller " , " Bad " is just a few pints short of the greatness I expected .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B00000269M	5	This album went right along with " Let It Loose " from Gloria Estefan and " Whitney " from Whitney Houston , in 1987 , 3 albums that I just could n't stop listening to and with 7 songs released how could you stop . <sssss> " Bad " , " The Way You Make Me Feel " , " Dirty Diana " and " Smooth Criminal " were some of my favorites from this album all 7 releases hit the top 10 , 5 went to # 1 , only " Another Part Of Me " and " Smooth Criminal " did not , this is a classic album , I dare I say this like this somewhat more than " Thriller " and " Leave Me Alone " added later to the album also became a Top 10 hit . <sssss> One Of Michael 's Baddest-in a goo way
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00000269M	5	Following up a blockbuster like " Thriller " would have been impossible for anyone , but Michael Jackson proved he was more than up to the task ! <sssss> While the much touted Stevie / Michael duet is the only real sin here , the rest of " Bad " is quite good ! <sssss> There are no filler tracks , and even at it 's sappiest ( " I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You " ) this work is still transcendent . <sssss> My favorite cuts are the biting indictment of " Leave Me Alone " ( still the best video of his career ! <sssss> ) , " Speed Demon " ( cheesy yes , but also catchy as heck ) and the slow , bubbling passion of " Liberian Girl " ( should have been a single ) . <sssss> " Bad " is essentially a greatest hits package covering ' 87 - '89 since 5 tracks here were number 1 's and everthing here was worthy of release as a hit or B-side . <sssss> Just chalk this up as another Jackson classic , not as consistently great as " Thriller " , but a worthy sequel .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B0000026WD	4	Dangerous by Michael Jackson could easily be his best album , better than Thriller . <sssss> Michael sings his heart out and this album contains some of the best guitar riffs I have ever heard thanks to Slash from Guns N Roses . <sssss> Songs that still have me hooked are : Give Into Me , Who Is It , Will You Be There , Gone Too Soon , In the Closet , Black or White , and Jam . <sssss> After the release of this album , Michael 's career was never the same but at least this album has stood the test of time . <sssss> Enjoy !
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B0000026WD	5	THRILLER was first , BAD was second and this one , DANGEROUS , was the King Of Pop 's third megahit . <sssss> This album was released in 1991 with a limited quantity of LP copies . <sssss> How weird the concept of the cover is . <sssss> A dog as a king on a throne dressed in of course , royal attire . <sssss> This album would remain on the charts through early 1993 . <sssss> JAM , the first track on this album is in some ways associated with basketball . <sssss> The rap lyrics were spoken by basketball great Shaquille O'Neal . <sssss> IN THE CLOSET was a hit but did not appear on HISTORY BOOK I , PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE in ' 95 . <sssss> REMEMBER THE TIME , BLACK OR WHITE and HEAL THE WORLD were hits also , all of them appearing on HISTORY . <sssss> Other hits are WHO IS IT ? <sssss> , the very last hit in early ' 93 , and WILL YOU BE THERE ? <sssss> which would become the theme for the movie " Free Willy " the same year . <sssss> GIVE IN TO ME features Guns 'N Roses ' Saul " Slash " Huson , playing electric guitar . <sssss> The title track is cool . <sssss> All the other songs are good . <sssss> Total playing time for this CD is 77 minutes and 8 seconds .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B0000026WD	4	Dangerous ~ Michael Jackson is not nearly as good as thriller , bad or off the wall . <sssss> The sound even when it was released sounded a bit dated and it sounds like he uses the same spiel as he did on the Bad album and it does not work as well . <sssss> There are some good tracks such " Black or white " , " Remember the time " ( yeah , that was the song for the video with Eddie Murphy playing the role of the King and I think Naomi Campel , but I am not sure , it has been quite many years since I saw it ) and the overly sentimental but effective track " Heal the World " . <sssss> However , MJ has set the bar high for himself with previous releases such as Thriller and Bad and this is not on the same level and he could have used a new producer to made give him new ideas . <sssss> The book-let is atrocious and the cover-art does not make any sense at all and seems to be a hopscotch of things put together at random with no real sense of direction behind it . <sssss> On the whole this a good album and 4 stars is not a bad mark for an album that just does not have the brilliance of the past .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B0000026WD	5	I grew up with this type of music , so this is my fave MJ album . <sssss> See if Quincy was around for this album it would definitley not be the style of music it is , all of this album is very good , " Gone Too Soon " is the weakest track . <sssss> As I said in My " BAD " Review " Dangrous " Done something most albums cant do and also done something most albums would / can do . <sssss> It Sold more than its Predessor " Bad " !! <sssss> But it only got 1 # 1 Single , " Black Or White " all the rest were very top 40 . <sssss> He sold out tours worldwide , but unfortunatley this would be the last HUGE selling MJ album . <sssss> in 1993 he got charged with child molestation so this pretty much ruined his career . <sssss> But this album is a total classic but it definitley deserved more credit than it got . <sssss> If you should own two MJ albums only , This one " DANGEROUS " is defitley one you should have , it is one of his best .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B0000026WD	4	Dangerous is almost a perfect album , it has some of his best music ever , since Thriller . <sssss> Some of those songs include the first song on the album , Jam . <sssss> This is such a fresh sounding song , with intense beats and hardcore grooves . <sssss> In The Closet is another great song with nice beats and melodies , but the intro we could have done without . <sssss> Remember The Time is one of his best songs in years . <sssss> Black Or White is a good song , but would be better without the cheap rap in the middle . <sssss> Who is it is one of his best songs that hes ever done , and Give In To Me is another great song as well with a guest appearance by Slash . <sssss> The title track is another song with great beats , another great song too . <sssss> The only songs I dont enjoy on Dangerous are Heal The World , good message but it just overdoes the ' making things better ' message , he should take it down a notch or two , his sister Janet masters those issues best on her Rhythm Nation 1814 album . <sssss> Will You Be There and Keep The Faith , they are nice songs but way too long and overproduced . <sssss> Gone Too Soon is a nice tribute but it doesnt appeal to me really . <sssss> I suggest to get this album if you want to hear some of his best songs .
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B0000026WD	3	Full of synth heavy , electronic beats , rap , and repetitive lyrics throughout , this is not one of Jackson 's finest albums , although it is certainly danceable . <sssss> Some of the lyrics seem to be almost autobiographical and an attempt to explain himself to people , as in " Why you wan na trip on me " and " Black or white " . <sssss> There are certainly catchable hooks in this album , but all are electronically generated and just repeat over and over again . <sssss> The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics ( you will see how very repetitive they are , and not at all intelligent ) . <sssss> But if you are a big Jackson fan , then I suppose you should own this album as well .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B0000026WD	5	Let me start by saying , the only difference between this album and the original DANGEROUS is that this one is remastered . <sssss> There is new pictures in the booklet as well , like in his other remasters , but there are no extra tracks or interviews . <sssss> That 's no big deal , because DANGEROUS is an excellent album . <sssss> After a lengthy gap of nearly five years , Jackson had to pull something out of the bag . <sssss> BAD was , after all , a difficult act to follow , and the press were trying to prove he was bonkers . <sssss> This was a pretty decent attempt and fell in with the hard dance beat of the early 90s . <sssss> " Heal The World " was much like the old melodic Jackson , and it became a major hit . <sssss> " Black Or White " was the best of the rest , a well-constructed song in which he attempted to repeat " Ebony And Ivory " in the context of 90s dance music . <sssss> Other highlights on the album include " Give In To Me " , " Jam " , " In The Closet " , " Remember The Time " , " Who Is It " and more . <sssss> Well worth the money !
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B0000026WD	5	Michael Jackson is a rare artist who can easily slip in and out of all kinds of musical styles and genres . <sssss> From r & b to rock to dance to fast songs to ballads , the self proclaimed King of Pop is chameleon-like in his approach . <sssss> Dangerous is another example of his variety . <sssss> " Jam " is a furious , beat heavy song and " Why You Wan na Trip On Me " is an intense number . <sssss> " In The Closet " has a slinky groove and " Remember The Time " has a silky smooth sound . <sssss> " Heal The World " attempts to be another " We Are The World " , but one can forgive him as you know his intentions are pure . <sssss> " Black Or White " has a jangly guitar riff that is the backbone of the song . <sssss> " Give In To Me " is a hard rocker and " Will You Be There " has a gospel like chorus . <sssss> Dangerous is an eclectic mixed bag that Mr. Jackson shows he is willing to mix it up and try different things .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B0000026WD	4	Although Michael Jackson is one of history 's greatest entertainers , he , like is sister Janet , benefits by being paired with a brilliant producer . <sssss> Master musician Quincy Jones worked magic on the singer 's landmark albums ( " Off the Wall " , the super-platinum and award-winning " Thriller " and " Bad " ) . <sssss> In the case of " Dangerous " , Jackson scored big with the songs either co-written or produced by Teddy Riley . <sssss> The seven selections bearing the " stamp of approval " by Riley make this an essential album to have by " The Gloved One " . <sssss> Although the disc shows the beginnings of wretched excess by the singer ( three of the songs should 've been eliminated ) , it still showcases the entertainer at his best . <sssss> Besides the seven ( " Jam " , " Why You Wan na Trip on Me " , the enigmatic " In the Closet " , " She Drives Me Wild " , the superior " Remember the Time " , " Ca n't Let Her Get Away " , and the title cut ) , other highlights include the monster smash " Black or White " and " Will You Be There " . <sssss> Now , if we could get Jackson to steer away from over-emoting as he does on the sappy " Gone ' Too Soon " , then he might be able to return to his rightful place as the " King of Pop " . <sssss> He just does n't need to dangle any more babies over banisters .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B0000026WD	5	I actually really liked this cd . <sssss> This has to be one of the best Michael Jackson albums he 's ever came out with ! <sssss> The beats are awseome , the songs are classic , and the messages are great ! <sssss> My favorite track had to be dangerous . <sssss> I thought the beats were slick and the hooks were great . <sssss> I actually really liked Jam to that has to be an interesting hidden gem from michael jackson . <sssss> I thought it was really good . <sssss> This is truly another pop classic album ! <sssss> I thought it was really good . <sssss> It 's very similiar to Janet 's rhythmn nation album ! <sssss> If you like pop music and are a fan of rock then this album is def . <sssss> for you !
AE31M52VLKOG6	B0000026WD	5	I consider Dangerous to be Michael Jackson 's last great album . <sssss> This album has it all . <sssss> It has excellent dance songs like " Remember The Time " , " Jam " , " In The Closet " and the title track . <sssss> This album has uplifting songs like Heal The World and Will You Be There . <sssss> I love the edgy sensual song " Give In To Me " . <sssss> This album has touching tracks like " Black Or White " and the prophetic " Gone Too Soon " . <sssss> I love this album .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B0000026WD	5	While this 1991 LP hardly needed remastering , the newly cleaned up sound and production is very welcome and makes an already great album sound better . <sssss> " She Drives Me Wild " is a Teddy Riley masterpiece that makes broken glass , car horns and heavy percussion all sound insanely musical and funky , while " Dangerous " ( the brilliant title track also produced by Riley ) still slams as hard as it did a decade ago and Jackson 's deep , spoken word delivery haunts you long after the track is over . <sssss> Now is the perfect time for a new generation to discover the last truly great New Jack Swing LP of the 90 's .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B0000026WD	5	... notwithstanding his troubled pr , I kinda dig the darker mijax tunes ... " in the closet " , " give in to me " , " dangerous " , " why u wan na trip " ... they make some of the serious soul searching tunes ... " keep the faith " , " will you be there " " gone too soon " ... that much poignant . <sssss> Mixtures ( all the same jam ) of the darker / searching mijax trax were seen in HiStory I & II , ie , especially notice the tunes " ghosts " and " morphene " ... <sssss> I think he oughtta get with Bristol 's Massive Attack 'cause I think they can take mijax to a whole new thang while in line w / dangerous and moody trax ...
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B000002BE9	4	There are only two albums by her I can stomach . <sssss> The other one is " When The Pawn ... " which is more upbeat . <sssss> But this one is very calm sounding pretty much throughout . <sssss> I love her lyrics which paint pictures and make her seem all the more intelligent . <sssss> The album is pretty downbeat but there are two or so songs that are more upbeat ( " Criminal " and " The First Taste " ) . <sssss> The album is kind of intense but without making you feel tense . <sssss> If you like sad music then you will be at ease . <sssss> Some of the best tracks to me are " Sleep To Dream " , " Sullen Girl " , " Pale September " and " Carrion " . <sssss> I do like Fiona 's voice and think her range is decent but sometimes she goes a little off-key . <sssss> Her voice is pretty unique though just like her look . <sssss> I say the CD 's a keeper .4.4 stars .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000002BE9	3	Fiona Apple debut album Tidal is a great collection of poetry-driven lyrics and excellent song arrangments . <sssss> Standout tracks include : Never is a Promise , Sullen Girl , Shadowboxer , Sleep to Dream , and Criminal . <sssss> The rest of the tracks are too sleepy or strange for me . <sssss> The song I ca n't get enough is Sullen Girl , Fiona was raped by a stranger when she only 12 and this song is about that horrible experience , " But he washed me ashore and he took my pearl and left an empty shell of me and there 's too much going on but it 's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion " . <sssss> Shadowboxer is the best song on the record , her voice is gorgeous and full on this haunting song , " So I 'll be sure to stay wary of you love , to save the pain of once my flame and tiwce my burn ... " She sure can write ! <sssss> also check-out her sophomore effort , When the Pawn ...
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B000002BE9	5	This is probably one of the best CD 's I 've ever heard . <sssss> I found myself drowning in her sullen aptitude four years ago when I bought this and am still caught in her current of succession . <sssss> Her lyrics are dark and poetic and far-beyond her 18 yrs . <sssss> , shedding some talent in this time of mindless pop ... <sssss> In the past her Grammy was well-deserved , and though I think that ' When The Pawn ' is a step down the ladder from this , she 's well deserving of many more . <sssss> Her tone is powerful and thick with passion , her piano playing exceedingly good for her age . <sssss> Fiona has real finesse when it comes to creating unforgettable melodies that will stick in your head for years to come ... <sssss> Highlights for me include Sleep To Dream , Sullen Girl , Slow Like Honey , The First Taste , Never Is A Promise , and Pale September . <sssss> Highly recommended for fans of rock that 's moody yet classy too .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B000002BE9	4	Every now and then I like to go into my ( enormous ) cd collection and throw in a cd that I have n't listened to in years . <sssss> Fiona Apple 's " Tidal " is just one of those cds . <sssss> As much as I enjoyed " When the Pawn ... " , I always thought that " Tidal " was a vastly superior album . <sssss> I thought that " When the Pawn ... " lacked the rawness of " Tidal " and was too polished . <sssss> I feel like I am watching Fiona perform as I listen to " Tidal " . <sssss> There is a live feel to the album . <sssss> Plus with " Tidal " , there is a more jazz / torch sound to the music than on the schizophrenic " When the Pawn ... " . <sssss> Ballads like " Sullen Girl " and " Shadowboxer " takes my breath away . <sssss> Originally when Fiona Apple first came out with " Tidal " , I was n't too wild about her but the more I heard the songs " Shadowboxer " , " Sleep to Dream " , and " Criminal " , the songs grew on me like a barnacle on a humpback whale . <sssss> The songs just stuck in my head . <sssss> I particularly loved the haunting ballads " The Child is Gone " and " Pale September " . <sssss> The songs gives me goosebumps just listening to them . <sssss> I love singing the opening lines to " Criminal " . <sssss> The lyrics are just fun to sing along to . <sssss> Of course whenever I listen to " Criminal " , I think of the provovcative music video Fiona shot with famed music video director Mark Romacek ( sp ? <sssss> ) . <sssss> After listening to " Tidal " , I sure hope that Fiona manges to squeeze out another album sometime during this lifetime . <sssss> Good things comes to those who wait I suppose .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B000002BE9	4	I bought this disc back in 1996 after hearing a lot of buzz & hype about Fiona Apple . <sssss> After my first listen and now 10 years later , I still had the same reaction , " Wow - she 's only 18 writing songs like this !? " Even today it is so refreshing to hear such poetically beautiful lyrics set to original composition . <sssss> Her smoky voice is haunting and while she is not the best vocalist I 've ever heard ; like another great singer / songwriter , Laura Nyro , Fiona sings HER songs with such passion & conviction that eclipses the fact that she 's not a vocal powerhouse . <sssss> I also love the fact that she so successfully mixed different genres of music to create own sound . <sssss> My favorite tracks : THE FIRST TASTE , SLOW LIKE HONEY , CRIMINAL , PALE SEPTEMBER & NEVER IS A PROMISE .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000002BE9	4	Whenever I think of this album , besides thinking that it 's amazing , I think how of how deep " Fiona Apple " is beyond her years . <sssss> She was 18 when this came out ! <sssss> The smoothness of this album , the musicianship , and of course that voice , all simply stunning . <sssss> The first track " Sleep To Dream " has one of my favorite lyrics : " You say love is a hell and you can not bare , and I say give me mine back , and then go there for all I care " . <sssss> The hit here is " Criminal " , but other songs like " Shadowboxer " and " Never Is A Promise " are just as good . <sssss> I highly suggest getting this album . <sssss> It 'll go great with your " Tori Amos " and " Maxwell " cd 's .
A5889INEGKCQY	B000002BE9	2	Overall a boring album . <sssss> Fiona Apple writes good lyrics and okay music . <sssss> Musically it is not very compelling and she tries to be a bit jazzy , bit rockish and poppish and even though she manages to be that all she does n't do it very well . <sssss> Her voice is irritating and constant moaning does n't help either . <sssss> Her Piano playing is overlooked by the mass production which often distract the listners from the music . <sssss> Obviously talented but this album is n't very good in my opinion .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B000002BE9	5	I love this album because it is not " Britney Spears " , get up and dance , snap your fingers music . <sssss> " Tidal " represents the part of life that makes you sit down and hold your head in your hands , and it is a much needed breath of smokey air in a bubblegum society . <sssss> Songs such as " Sleep to Dream " and the wonderful " Shadowboxer " show that this young woman has much to offer in the future .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B000002BE9	4	Fiona Apple was signed to a major label in 1995 on the strenght of a demo tape of a few songs . <sssss> She was 18 , and a major label signing an unknown teenager was possible only because we now know ( in retrospect ) that 1995-96 were the heydays of the " alternative music " scene , and anything was possible . <sssss> " Tidal " ( 10 tracks , 51 min . <sssss> ) , released almost 8 years to the day , was auspicious in many respects . <sssss> The confessional writing style , the jazzy-smokey pop ( do n't even think Norah Jones , but more a jazzier Tori Amos or Aimee Mann ) , it all struck a cord . <sssss> And a few killer songs helped tremendously of course . <sssss> " Shadowboxer " became a breakout hit , and justifiably so , it still sounds good today , 8 years later . <sssss> Other oustanding tracks include the opener " Sleep to Dream " , " The First Taste " ( with great lyrics like " Darling Just Start the Chase / I 'll Let You Win / But You Must Make the Endeavour " ) , and " Pale September " , featuring the vibraphone which is used throughout the album , very effectively . <sssss> However , the very best of them all " Never Is A Promise " , a haunting ballad . <sssss> Since " Tidal " , Fiona has released only one other album ( 1999 's oustanding " When The Pawn " ) , but supposedly we will finally see a new album later this year . <sssss> Meanwhile , " Tidal " is aging quite nicely . <sssss> Strongly recommended ! <sssss> * UPDATE * ( June , 2012 ) Just saw Fiona on her current tour in support of " The Idler Wheel " , what an electric performance . <sssss> I have seen her on a number of occasions , including on the original " Tidal " tour here in Cincinnati . <sssss> The current tour brings songs from all 4 studio albums pretty evenly , including 4 tracks from Tidal : Dream to Sleep , Shadowboxer , Carrion , and of course Criminal . <sssss> If you can see her on this tour , absolutely do not miss it !
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B000002BE9	5	I do n't understand why in this days it 's so hard to find new muzik that it 's worth your ears , aghhhh ! <sssss> , but let 's go back then to the basics , Miss Apple gave an impressive debut filled wtih sadness and depression , my type of album , along with Amos , Kilcher , and Merchant this ladies put the mood for the mid-90 's , this album deserve the success it achieve , I do n't know what 's Apple been up to ? <sssss> , but please comeback ... personal favorites are Shadowboxer , first listen of this great album , Criminal the pop crossover , but still great , Never Is A Promise makes me cry , this is the best , A First Taste , wow ! <sssss> makes me wan na dance ?! <sssss> do you believe that ! <sssss> , Slow Like Honey , surreal ! <sssss> , those r my picks , but this album is overall good fair worth your pennies , and all that things some people post and strut about , I just say , if you 're sad and need some sad music to cry along , this is it , such a good painful album ... . <sssss> way to go Fiona ...
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B000002LGQ	5	This album has been without a doubt the highlight of Madonna 's 20 year career . <sssss> It has a light-hearted , fun pop sound to it , yet the album has insight and is very personal at the same time . <sssss> Combining these elements makes a truly great album . <sssss> I truly think that " Like A Prayer " was the album that solidified Madonna as a superstar and showed the world that she 'd be around for years to come . <sssss> Of course , she was already a huge star coming off of three massively successful albums and numerous top 10 hits but before this album , I 'm sure the critics were still predicting her demise . <sssss> The album begins with the # 1 title track which is one of my favorite Madonna songs . <sssss> Everyone has heard it . <sssss> " Express Yourself " hit # 2 on the charts and is a great dance track and I loved the video . <sssss> She also had top 10 hits with the fun pop ditty " Cherish " * another of my faves * and the family anthem " Keep It Together " . <sssss> " Oh Father " was a top 20 hit and one of Madonna 's best songs to this day . <sssss> It 's a heart-breaking ballad about her relationship with her father as a child . <sssss> " Dear Jessie " is a bouncy pop song showing off Madonna 's soft side or even " maternal " side if you would . <sssss> " Promise to Try " is another great ballad in the tradition of " Oh Father " . <sssss> I also enjoy " Till Death Do Us Part " although it 's a more serious track disguised by a great pop sound . <sssss> Even if you have the " Immaculate Collection " * like I did * I still recommend this album . <sssss> Not only do you get the superior album versions of the singles that were included , you also get " Oh Father " and " Keep It Together " which were not included . <sssss> And the filler on this album is just as good as the singles . <sssss> Do n't pass this one up .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B000002LGQ	5	I love this record . <sssss> I remember the first time I heard " Like a Prayer " . <sssss> I absolutely love this song . <sssss> It is my all time favorite from Madonna . <sssss> The soft and loud parts are truly awesome and the lyrics are truly exceptional . <sssss> I can listen to this album from beginning to end . <sssss> I love all of the songs , specially " Oh father " , " Promise to try " and " Express Yourself " , although I like the version that appears on " THe Inmaculate Collection " much better . <sssss> I think this is Madonna 's best cd ; the others ca n't even come close to it .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000002LGQ	5	Madonna 's Like A Prayer is my second favorite album , my first being Ray of Light . <sssss> Like A Prayer is a classic , Madonna bares her soul on every track . <sssss> Her songwriting is strong here , standout tracks include : the title-track , Til Death Do Us Part , Cherish , Promise to Try , Spanish Eyes , and Oh Father . <sssss> Love Song is also fresh and entertaining ( a deut with Prince ) . <sssss> The first time I heard Promise to Try I wept like a baby , so heartbreaking , the song is about her mother 's death . <sssss> Like A Prayer is pure genius , the perfect album to end the decade she entered in as an artist . <sssss> Of course the best song is Cherish , could this song be any cuter ? <sssss> All hail Madonna !
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B000002LGQ	5	This album features the B-52 's biggest hit ever , LOVE SHACK . <sssss> The video is quite awesome also . <sssss> The song was even heard in the 1991 Paramount film FRANKIE & JOHNNY . <sssss> I even heard another hit , ROAM in one or two television commercials . <sssss> The title track is cool so is DEADBEAT CLUB . <sssss> Another hit is CHANNEL Z . <sssss> The instrumental FOLLOW YOUR BLISS was probably inspired by Todd Rundgren 's HELLO IT 'S ME ( they both sound almost identical ) . <sssss> After this album , band member Kate Pierson would join R.E.M. <sssss> recording ME IN HONEY on R.E.M. <sssss> 's 1991 multi-platinum OUT OF TIME .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B000002LGQ	4	Like a Prayer is Madonnas 1989 release and her 4th studio album is not one of my favorite Madonna albums . <sssss> Still it has many fine tracks , i.e. <sssss> , Express Yourself , Cherish , Keep it together and Dear Jessie . <sssss> I never liked like a prayer mostly because I do not like gospel music . <sssss> The book-let is so so . <sssss> The cover art is confusing . <sssss> I have no idea what she meant with this one . <sssss> We get a nice list of personnel and muisicians and who played what . <sssss> The lyrics could have been in a bit larger font as I find it a bit small . <sssss> The center photo is a bit strange with a pose that is supposed to mean something that I have no idea what . <sssss> 4/5 .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B000002LGQ	5	With 1989 's Like A Prayer , Madonna finally seemed to silence critics who were under the impression that she was about nothing but the beat and being a material girl . <sssss> By far her finest effort up to that point , Like A Prayer focuses on so many issues that at that point many of us in the public were already privy to -- the disintegration of her marriage to Sean Penn , her relationship with her father , et al . <sssss> That she manages to do this while retaining a pop savvy that has yet to be matched by few of her contemporaries is a testament to her continued relevance as not only a pop icon , but more importantly , an artist of remarkable depth and scope . <sssss> While the title track stirred great controversy at the time of its ' release , many at the time forgot that , bottom line , it was a great pop record . <sssss> Same can be said for the succeeding singles , particularly the great ' Cherish ' , and the truly heartwrenching ' Oh Father ' ( one of her many overlooked masterpieces ) . <sssss> For those just starting out on Madonna , this is the best place to begin .
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B000002LGQ	5	I am far from being a Madonna fan , but Like a Prayer is a classic . <sssss> This record showed that Madonna -- essentially a singles artist -- is capable of making a thematically coherent , mature album that also features a load of great songs that stand on their own . <sssss> From the first notes on the record , the apocalyptic guitars that introduce the title track , there 's something different about this record . <sssss> An attention to detail , an aggressiveness , and also a sophistication beyond her previous releases ... and anything else she 's recorded since . <sssss> " Like a Prayer " is unforgettable ; even though Madonna 's voice is hardly gospel material , it 's precisely the tension between her dance-pop voice and the Andrae Crouch Choir 's booming chants that makes the track so powerful . <sssss> A black-white fusion with an unstoppable beat and an instantly memorable chorus . <sssss> " Express Yourself " is not one of my favourite tracks possibly due to over-exposure , but you have to admit , it 's another instantly recognizable song and Madonna 's mission statement of sorts . <sssss> The pop songwriting is flawless on " Till Death Do Us Part " , " Keep It Together " and " Spanish Eyes " , and " Oh Father " is hands down my favourite Madonna song . <sssss> Who would 've thought she could convey so much heart in such a simple song ? <sssss> The " You never wanted to live that way " interlude is beautiful beyond words . <sssss> Classic video , too , a childlike dream directed by David Fincher . <sssss> I 've heard the whole Madonna canon hundreds of times growing up ( there was a fanatic in the house ) and most of her music 's grown stale on me , except this record . <sssss> Because of her adaptability to trends , most of her albums sound dated , so in tune are they with the musical movements of their time . <sssss> But if there 's one record of hers that stands beyond time , this is it .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000002LGQ	5	The potential of this album was never fully explored because it was overshadowed very much by the controversies that surround the title track 's video . <sssss> But cast away the imageries , Like A Prayer ranks as one of the best Madonna albums . <sssss> The gospel-infused title track rocked the house down . <sssss> Express Yourself dares you to do so and never take what 's second best . <sssss> Cherish shows the sun-sweetness of Madonna with such girl-woman charm . <sssss> Keep It Together implores you to live harmoniously with one 's most important link - the family . <sssss> And the highlight must be Oh Father which stirs up so much emotions , a perfect ode by Madonna . <sssss> There 's the oh-so-sensuous duet with Prince and so many more . <sssss> Indeed a gem !
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B000002LGQ	4	For awhile now I was mostly a fan of Madonna 's current work with " Ray of Light " and " Music " but lately I have been influenced to delve deeper into her large catalog . <sssss> " Like A Prayer " is the last album she would do straight-forward pop before moving on to incorporating different genres of music with pop music like the r & b-influenced ; sound on " Bedtime Stories " . <sssss> After listening to the original versions of " Like A Prayer " and " Express Yourself " ( as opposed to the IC 's versions ) , I ca n't say I prefer one version over the other . <sssss> Both songs are great , remixed or not . <sssss> I did n't particularly care for " Love Song " , otherwise I would have given this cd a 5-star review . <sssss> I do n't think that was one of Madonna 's better songs overall . <sssss> " Til Death Do Us Part " is excellent , one of my favorite non-single tracks off this overall excellent album . <sssss> Asides from " Love Song " , I love " Like A Prayer " . <sssss> It is definitely one of Madonna 's better albums pre - " Ray of Light " .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B000002LGQ	5	Not that there was anything to not like about the " bubblegum " Madonna of the early / mid 80s , but on this album , Madonna shows a much deeper and more spiritual side of herself that many people probably did n't know was there at the time . <sssss> " Deep , dark and haunting " is probably the best way to describe many of the songs on this album , especially " Oh Father " and " Promise To Try " . <sssss> Of course , Madonna does n't completely abandon what made her famous in the first place , and songs like the title track , " Express Yourself " , and " Cherish " show that she was well able to incorporate her new lyrical maturity into the breezy , upbeat pop settings that served her ( and us ) well so many times before .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000002LGQ	5	This is Madonna 's best album from the 80s . <sssss> It opens with the title track , which is a classic Madonna , and one of her biggest hits . <sssss> " Express Yourself " also earns that honor of distinctive songs you think of when you think of Madonna . <sssss> She collaborates with Prince on the funky " Love Song " . <sssss> LIKE A PRAYER has some of her best ballads , like the ode to her mother on " Promise To Try " , or the excellent " Spanish Eyes " . <sssss> There 's some nice uptempos like " Keep It Together " and " Til Death Do Us Part " . <sssss> This is definately one of her best albums of her career . <sssss> " Oh Father " is a great ballad and truly sad . <sssss> The singles from this album include the title track , " Express Yourself " , " Keep It Together " , " Cherish " , " Oh Father " and " Dear Jessie " in some countries . <sssss> A must have for any music collection .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B000002LGQ	5	Madonna has 7 full length studio albums out there , which one to buy first ? <sssss> Well , they 're all great discs , excluding the dated and naive debut . <sssss> While Like A Virgin and Ray Of Light are definite contenders , I always like it when an artist takes a risk . <sssss> Madonna did just that in 1989 with Like a Prayer and then did it again in 1992 with Erotica . <sssss> However , Like a Prayer is tighter , more cohesive than Erotica . <sssss> Like a Prayer is the first time Madonna expressed deeper emotion in her lyrics , and it was the first time her music was no longer Spice Girlish . <sssss> Songs about religion , death , divorce , camraderie , childhood , love and self-respect fill this wonderful disc . <sssss> It 's true , as the people before me have attested : There is not a note wasted on this cd , all the tracks are great . <sssss> Sure , the duet between Prince and Madonna could have been left off , but it adds more flavor to the cd 's rich well of songs . <sssss> It 's worth the money to have this in your music collection .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000002LGQ	5	This was Madonna 's first album where she dealt with controversy . <sssss> Actually her first song that was somewhat controversial was Papa Do n't Preach , but with this album , Madonna shocked the masses with the controversial video for Like A Prayer . <sssss> Like A Prayer became a career song for Madonna , and a fan favorites . <sssss> Backed with a choir , Madonna pleads love to her lover in this excellent song , one of Madonna 's best . <sssss> Express Yourself also became a household song for Madonna , a song that demands respect for women . <sssss> Love Song is an underrated song , its a gem which Prince lends his vocals to . <sssss> One of the most compelling beautiful songs on this album is the simplistic Promise To Try , one of the album 's best . <sssss> Spanish Eyes is also an excellent song . <sssss> This is one of the best album 's from the 80 's , its way ahead of its time . <sssss> Some great material here that people can relate to , or at least find something they enjoy inside of the music . <sssss> Behind the music , there is a message , listen for it .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B000002LGQ	2	I 'm not a really a big fan of this album . <sssss> Well , it just plain sucks . <sssss> It 's really bad 80 's pop and it sounds outdated . <sssss> And I love 80 's music ! <sssss> I mean her other 80 's stuff is a lot better then this crap . <sssss> I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain ( boy was i wrong ) . <sssss> It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together . <sssss> Other then that Express yourself ( well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid ) . <sssss> Like a Prayer is ok , the video and concept are great . <sssss> But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much , even today . <sssss> ( its like mj with thriller , it gets old quick ! <sssss> ) It 's really not that great of a song . <sssss> The only one that I really like is act of contrition . <sssss> It 's got sort of a rhythm nation feel to it . <sssss> It 's very good and creative . <sssss> Other then that I would not waste two cents on this CD .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B000002LGQ	5	This has to be Madonna 's more introspective album , more than " Ray Of Light " , adopting for the first time her original brunette style hair , this is Madonna attempt to be more real than ever , Like A Prayer , Oh Father , Pray For Spanish Eyes , Act of Contrition , Promise To Try , are the cuts that are so deep into their lyrics that reveal a Madonna far away from the pop-material-girl that we are used to , Cherish is a pure example of a uplifting song , Express Yourself declares independence , Keep It Together rejoices about the importance of family values , in all Madonna 's " Like A Prayer " will leave you satisfy and longing for the next Madonna step , such a great classic album , worth every penny . <sssss> Ricardo
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000002LGQ	5	In the 1980s , Madonna suffered an affliction common amongst most young pop stars : success with no acclaim . <sssss> While she had no problem racking up Top Ten hits and selling platinum records , Madonna 's critics , for the most part , saw her as little more than a tacky gimmick who spent more time baring her navel than her soul on record . <sssss> But " Like a Prayer " changed all that , for it was an ablum of surpirsing gravity and full of introspective lyrics . <sssss> Sometimes , when singers go the " take-me-seriously " route , it can come across as phony and contrived . <sssss> But the emotions conveyed on " Like a Prayer " sound pretty real . <sssss> She recalls her tumultuous marriage to Sean Penn on " Til Death Do Us Part " , addresses a stormy relationship with her father in " Oh Father " , and makes a tribute to her late mother in " Promise to Try " , a ballad strong enough to make a grown man cry . <sssss> And , yes , there are the hits : the bouncy " Express Yourself " , the title track with its effective gospel choir , the bubbly " Cherish " , and the pro-family " Keep it Together " . <sssss> This album marked a high point in Madonna 's career . <sssss> Although she 's still coming up with dance hits bouncy enough to make you shake your thang , " Like a Prayer " shows that she can deliver music that 's not simply high on concept , but also high on content .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B000002LGQ	5	In case you 're wondering any Madonna album I review always get 5 stars because she has nothing to prove to me , nonetheless she does it anyway . <sssss> With " Like A Prayer " the album in 1989 already 12 years old she gave us a glimpse that she was maturing as an artist . <sssss> And like her previous and future album she gave us even more hits ( 12 years old WOW ! <sssss> ) . <sssss> " Like A Prayer " the first single quickly went to # 1 , followed by " Express Yourself " ( excellent song ) , which hit # 1 , also " Cherish " ( another classic ) # 1 also then came the very dark " Oh Father " ( great video ) went Top 3 , and finishing with " Keep It Together " ( no video and all ) went to # 4 , just adding to the hits from this timeless artist , this album by the way made the 100 best album of all time , You Go Madonna ! <sssss> " Dear Jessie " the albums non-release over in the U.S. hit top 10 in the U.K. ( that video shows the softer side of Madonna ) . <sssss> Keep On Going Madonna !
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000002MFN	5	Erotica by Madonna is a brlliant and much ignored album . <sssss> Released in 1992 , this album was written off as a kiss of death , at first I did n't like it either but over the past year I have grown to love this album as much as Like A Prayer or Ray of Light . <sssss> Madge is at her best when she is angry and provactive . <sssss> The best song on the album is Words , could be the best song she has ever recorded . <sssss> Secret Garden , Where Life Begins , and Erotica are the only " dirty " tracks on the record , I like them all ! <sssss> We get some really beautiful moments on here like Rain , Waiting , In This Life , and Bye Bye Baby . <sssss> The song that 's pure camp is Thief of Hearts , I could listen to that under-rated gem all day . <sssss> I am so glad I gave Erotica another chance , Madonna is the only pop artist that takes risks anymore , this oldie but goodie does not disappoint ! <sssss> Enjoy .
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B000002MFN	5	In 1992 , Madonna out of her teen idol phase , put out this so-called " sexy " album . <sssss> That same year , she made her literary debut with SEX . <sssss> Here is the start of what would later become her GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 album , released in 2001 . <sssss> The title track is definitely sexy . <sssss> She covers the classic FEVER , which was previously recorded by a handful of other artists . <sssss> There 's the hip-hop flavored WHY IS IT SO HARD ? <sssss> and WAITING . <sssss> Excerpts of the latter track are heard on DID YOU DO IT ? <sssss> , which is also hip-hop flavored . <sssss> BAD GIRL is cool ( " Bad girl , drunk by six , kissing somebody else 's lips , smoked too many cigarettes today , I 'm not happy when I act this way " . <sssss> ) . <sssss> WHERE LIFE BEGINS has the rhythm that is called " groundbeat " . <sssss> THIEF OF HEARTS is mildly raunchy with lyrics like " Stop , bitch ! Now sit your ass down " ! <sssss> The other songs are great .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B000002MFN	3	After releasing four studio albums full of mostly accessible dance-pop / pop balladry , Madonna seemed to have decided to go for something a little different . <sssss> Always one to be at the forefront of pop culture , EROTICA was Madonna 's record geared toward the underground rave / dance culture . <sssss> Continuing the thread begun with ' Justify My Love ' , EROTICA features hard , cold dance beats coupled with Madonna 's most detached vocal work to date . <sssss> Because it was such a distinct departure from her previous work , the album was met initially with mediocre response , despite its ' attempt to be " erotic " . <sssss> I personally hated it the first time I listened to it . <sssss> No , this is probably the first ( and only ) Madonna record that takes repeated listens in order to ingratiate itself into the brain . <sssss> None of the tracks jump out upon first listen with the exception of the very fine ' Rain ' , still one of Madonna 's best ballads . <sssss> The title track is essentially a ' Justify My Love ' rehash with a different producer . <sssss> The album had several potential hits , but for some reason such snoozers as the appropriately titled ' Bad Girl ' and the house rave-up wannabe and just plain bad ' Deeper and Deeper ' were the tracks selected to essentially represent the album . <sssss> Besides the aforementioned ' Rain ' , other standouts include ' Thief of Hearts ' and ' Waiting ' . <sssss> For those who did n't give this record a second listen , give it another try . <sssss> Now that Madonna is reinventing her sound with literally every album , just think of this as the beginning of something great .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000002MFN	4	Everyone thought Madonna committed career suicide with this album , but she did n't . <sssss> As the most underrated Madonna album , Erotica contains a diverse range of musical influences . <sssss> The first lead-off title track contains a sample of Kool And The Gang 's Jungle Boogie and is fused into a hip-hop song with an Indian chant interlude . <sssss> Take away the erotic visions of the video and the book SEX , Erotica is a sensous , sexy and lusty song . <sssss> Other cool tracks include the remake of Peggy Lee 's Fever into an updated 90s dance ditty ; Rain , a stunningly written & produced ballad , the house number Deeper And Deeper and Words . <sssss> The problem with detractors is that they link the album with too many of the imageries that came along with SEX . <sssss> Put simply , the EROTICA album talks about sex , lust and human behavior towards the 2 issues .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000002MFN	4	" Erotica " was the beginning of 90 's Madonna , and really the start of her second phase if you will . <sssss> Good-bye to the sounds of the 80 's , and hello to an even more mature and sexy Madonna . <sssss> Considering all the singles that came from this , and the quality of the album in general , it seems rather underrated . <sssss> The title track and " Fever " were huge songs , and I think " Deeper And Deeper " is easily one of her best dance-tracks . <sssss> Two minor hits , and my personal favorites on the disc , are " Bad Girl " and " Rain " , both excellent in my opinion , yet neither made her " GHV2 " . <sssss> The only faults I really find are in the 2-3 filler tracks , and that the album is really long , 75 minutes . <sssss> Still , after " Ray Of Light " I think it 's the best of her second decade , and slightly better than the following album " Bedtime Stories " . <sssss> Even if you got this for only the five " hits " , it 's essential Madonna , and a bit erotic .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B000002MFN	3	I am not a real fan of Shep Pettibone as a producer . <sssss> His tracks are just too " house heavy " for my sensibilities . <sssss> So , when Madonna teamed up with him in the early '90s , she had some hits and some misses . <sssss> While EROTICA , RAIN , DEEPER AND DEEPER , and SECRET GARDEN were really good on this album , there are just some tracks that are just plain awful . <sssss> I consider this the beginning of Madonna 's transition from pop material girl to mature adult contemporary artist . <sssss> The transistion was n't really complete until the EVITA soundtrack . <sssss> I thought it was a good thing that Madonna explored [ a different ] realm of on this album . <sssss> Why not ? <sssss> It was a good thing to have a musical artist talk about a subject that , at that time , was just awakening from being completely taboo . <sssss> You have to give Madonna credit for looking at things that are n't exactly socially acceptable at the time . <sssss> It helps to shatter misconceptions and preconceived notions on a subject . <sssss> I think that is why you either love or hate this woman . <sssss> As for me , I pretty much like her . <sssss> She has her bad moments ... . <sssss> but after a 20 year career ... who would n't ! <sssss> But , she also has her good moments too . <sssss> I think EROTICA got a bad rap in 1992 ... and it still gets one today . <sssss> For those who are Madonna fans and did n't buy this one because of all of the scandals back then , you should pick it up now and give it a try . <sssss> You might be surprised . <sssss> For the Madonna newbie , this is definitely a collection you want to listen to as it does ... what AMERICAN LIFE does for politics .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000002MFN	5	This is one of my favorite Madonna albums , and her most misunderstood . <sssss> I guess it 's hard to take an album seriously when its called EROTICA , especially since the subject matter is not about sex , only on a handful of songs . <sssss> While I 'm not a huge fan of the Shep Pettibone tracks , her work with Andre Bette is among some of her best work , and those songs really standout . <sssss> The title track and " Where Life Begins " are the most sexually explicit songs , but they have a certain camp value ( at least to me ) . <sssss> She does a decent cover of the song " Fever " . <sssss> " Rain " is one of her best ballads of her career . <sssss> The album drags a little at the end with " Why 's It So Hard " and " In This Life " , nice sentiments but overall not too impressive , more boring than anything . <sssss> " Did You Do It " is a waste of time , plain and simple . <sssss> However , at the end is " Secret Garden " , which is one of the best songs on here ! <sssss> Other highlights include " Deeper and Deeper " , " Words " , " Waiting " , and more .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000002MFN	5	Many would consider this album Madonna 's first concept album . <sssss> This is where she really pushed people 's buttons . <sssss> The album deals with the taboo subject of sex , she 's saying its ok to talk about it , its a part of life . <sssss> The album just happens to have some of her most compelling songs on it . <sssss> Take the first single , the title track , or the reminiscent Deeper and Deeper . <sssss> Those are two definite standouts here . <sssss> The album deals with rather explicit material , hence the explicit lyrics . <sssss> On the flipside there are wonderful ballads that Madonna fans have come to love , such as Bad Girl and Rain . <sssss> There is something for everyone here , just listen and forget about the controversy , behind it there is the message which is undeniable . <sssss> Check out other standouts on the album such as Waiting , Secret Garden , Why 's It So Hard and In This Life . <sssss> The whole album is excellent . <sssss> See for yourself .
A5889INEGKCQY	B000002MFN	4	Erotica is a good album by Madonna . <sssss> Released in late 1992 in the sex-book scandal and the entire controversy surrounding that . <sssss> The album was a bit overlooked . <sssss> Critics disliked it and many fans of her previous album had also mixed feelings about it . <sssss> Madonna was obviously trying something different and she decided to team up again with Shep Pettibone who helped recording Justify My Love and co-wrote and produced Vouge . <sssss> Lyrically Madonna does not expose anything and sometimes just creates something that rymes . <sssss> There are two explicit tracks on this album . <sssss> The controversial title track and Where Life Begins . <sssss> Although Erotica is not lyrically fantastic it does not overshadow the music . <sssss> The music is a mixture of dance beats and house music and obviously Madonna was intriqued by it . <sssss> Most of the songs stand out and the album is enjoyable and dancable . <sssss> Erotica is still widely regarded as Madonna 's worst album and not just by critics but by fans also . <sssss> Even many of Madonna 's friends an were not impressed and the album was not just diapointing in sales but many felt that artistically Madonna was not doing the right thing . <sssss> Indeed she has been more focuses on what she was doing and I doubt that she was a whole lot in the studio while making it and let the producers do all the work . <sssss> I do n't know whether Madonna likes this album and I think that she was very disapointed about the reaction . <sssss> The album is good and unlike any of her albums it has no filler but indeed was perhaps a wrong direction for her at the time and she should have not released it at the time of the Sex-Book because it has hardly anything in common with it .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B000002MFN	5	The least commercially successful of the diva 's releases , " Erotica " boasted such a diverse collection that , perhaps in 1992 , it was too much of a variety to warrant large sales . <sssss> That withstanding , the album 's blend of pop , dance , jazz , and sexual innuendo makes it her most intriguing offering . <sssss> Starting off with the sensual title cut , the artist then " turns up the heat " with a reworking of the classic " Fever " . <sssss> " Bye , Bye , Baby " sounds as if it may have been left from the " Dick Tracy " soundtrack with Madonna singing as if through a megaphone . <sssss> The hit single " Deeper and Deeper " is of the " Vogue " school of thought . <sssss> Likewise , so are the songs " Thief of Hearts " and " Words " . <sssss> The ballads " Where Life Begins " , " Bad Girl " , " Rain " , and " In this Life " are subtle and indications of the interpretive skill that Madonna would exhibit years later with her work on " Evita " . <sssss> The most unusual of the cuts is the last one , " Secret Garden " , an intriguing blend of pop and jazz that lets Madonna be a little coyer than the previous offerings . <sssss> The outro by the band features a dynamic piano accompaniment .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B000002MFN	4	I was initially like ugh ! <sssss> This album looks stupid . <sssss> I was too young to remember when this came , but I thought it was just going to be filthy and trashy . <sssss> I was pleasnly surprised when zune recommended this to me and I listened to this . <sssss> I thought Erotica ( the song ) 's lyrics were really trashy but the beats made up for it . <sssss> Fever was an excellent track , I thought it had a great beat and Madonna has a great jazz voice to do covers on . <sssss> I thought Bad Girl was pretty good , and the video really made you think . <sssss> Deeper and Deeper great techno song . <sssss> Bye Bye Birdie ( I think the name of the track on this album ) was intersting and very good . <sssss> Rain was an excellent track and I thought it was creative and different . <sssss> I had never really heard a song done in that way before . <sssss> Def . <sssss> really experinmental almost like a Moby track . <sssss> The video had to be one of my favorite music videos of all time . <sssss> I just thought thee imgaery and style was pretty cool , and way ahead of its time ! <sssss> I thought it was actually pretty good , and intersting and different . <sssss> It was really just a pop album sheeped in wolfs clothing . <sssss> I thought it was some of her best work , not her best , and this album should be given her chance ! <sssss> If you love pop music , or techno then this the album for you .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000002MFN	5	By the end of 1990 , Madonna was sitting on top of the world . <sssss> She had monstrously huge single ( " Vogue " ) , launched a successful tour ( Blonde Ambition ) , and released a smash greatest hits album ( " The Immaculate Collection " ) which spawned a controversial yet popular single ( " Justify My Love " ) . <sssss> With all this and more under her belt , she released in the fall of 1992 her graphic " Sex " book and her " Erotica " album . <sssss> While the book was trashed by critics , the record was a disappointment on the charts . <sssss> It signaled the public 's disgust for the onetime Material Girl , who otherwise released a very fine album . <sssss> The title track picks up where " Justify My Love " left off with Madonna 's cool , spoken delivery against a mid-tempo beat . <sssss> " Deeper and Deeper " is an infectious house jam that could very well be " Vogue 2 " . <sssss> Madonna is most impressive when she works with hip hop beats , as evidenced on the sensual " Where Life Begins " and " Waiting " . <sssss> The rest of " Erotica " has some of Madonna 's most criminally overlooked material . <sssss> " Thief of Hearts " is a hilariously catty dis on a man-stealing woman , while " Words " is another housed-up tale on verbal abuse in a relationship . <sssss> But the disc 's touching moment is " In This Life " , a soaring , sap-free ballad that has Ms. Ciccone paying tribute to a lost one who succumbed to AIDS . <sssss> While this record was n't a bust , it fell way short of expectations saleswise . <sssss> Pick up " Erotica " , and let Madonna " put you in a trance " .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B000002MFN	5	I agree with those who reviewed this album , " Erotica " was very underrated because of the controvesy , with her " Sex " book she released the same time as the album . <sssss> " Erotica " has great songs on it , the first single " Erotica " was a terrific song , and I had no problems with the song , then came " Deeper And Deeper " the song that I think got truly lost on this album , this song continues to be a favorite for me and I think the song was very good for this album , it brought us Madonna back to the dance clubs , then there is " Fever " the remake which I think she did a nice job of remaking , and I love the video , next comes " Bad Girl " a sorely misunderstood song this was one of Madonna 's lowest charting songs , but I think it is one of her better songs and once again sounds like nothing out at the time and the video for " Bad Girl " was awesome , and finally " Rain " this should have put the " Erotica " album better appeal , the song is sung so well by Madonna , the way she sings over herself is just wonderful , but to end there is wrong with unreleased material like " Waiting " , " Thief Of Hearts " and " Bye Bye Baby " which should have been released , this is an album that should stand on its own and like all Madonna albums does . <sssss> I think a lot of the hoopla surrounding " Erotica " is unfair because this is a very overlooked album with great music and writing on it . <sssss> To dismiss this album just because of her " Sex " book is a big mistake . <sssss> Great album .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B000002MUW	4	This CD definately has some catchy songs , but I would n't say it 's better than Like a Prayer or Ray of Light . <sssss> " Secret " is a catchy , soft-rock tune . <sssss> The title track " Bedtime Story " is weird ( no wonder , it was written by Bjork ! <sssss> ) but I guess it 's okay . <sssss> " Human Nature " has a lot of cursing ( I 'm not your b ** ch , do n't hang your s ** t on me ! <sssss> ) , but it 's still a great song . <sssss> My favorite has to be the the # 1 single " Take a Bow " . <sssss> It 's perhaps Madonna 's best ballad . <sssss> All 'n all , if you are a Madonna fan , you got ta have this one .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B000002MUW	3	After listening to this cd , I feel it is more R & B and electronica than anything . <sssss> The songs are mostly mellow . <sssss> The ones I truly like are " Secret " ( one of Madonna 's best songs ) , " I 'd rather be your lover " , " Human Nature " , " Take a bow " and " Bedtime Stories " ( truly unique song ) . <sssss> What makes this album different from Like a Prayer is that I can listen to that cd entirely . <sssss> This one , to me , only stands out in this tracks . <sssss> Not a bad album , but could have been better .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000002MUW	4	Even though this is my least favorite cd from Madge , I do think there are some great r & b songs even though I prefer her pop songs instead . <sssss> Songs I do appreciate are : Survival , Secret , Human Nature , Forbidden Love , Bedtime Story and Take A Bow . <sssss> I heard Madge was frustrated when she worked on this album back in 1994 . <sssss> She complained there were too many producers and it caused this album to get second-guessed as her least creative work . <sssss> Human Nature is her strongest and fearless track of all-time , I love how frank and guiltless she sounds on that track . <sssss> I recommend Ray of Light and American Life , these are stronger albums but Bedtime Stories was good but not great , but I love ya Madge , so keep on doing your thang !
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B000002MUW	4	Bedtime Stories being Madonna 's 1994 release and her 6th studio release is a very mainstream album and therefore it became immensly popular . <sssss> After the controversial erotica album with its steamy lyrics and the controversy around the sex book Madonna wanted to tone down the sex factor on this album . <sssss> Secret is the absolut standout track on this release . <sssss> Take a bow is a really good track as well . <sssss> I love the lyrics to this song . <sssss> Something that is quite funny is that I did not know is that Madonna actually has two tracks with the same name in her collection , i.e. <sssss> , forbidden love . <sssss> One time on this release and another time on the confessions album . <sssss> The book-let is really nice . <sssss> Madonna looks quite normal and the blonde look at the time was quite flattering indeed .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B000002MUW	5	After the lukewarm response to EROTICA , Madonna forged ahead and again chose another musical form -- r & b/hip-hop -- to convey her music . <sssss> That said , BEDTIME STORIES remains my personal favorite Madonna album to date , if only because there is not one piece of filler to be found . <sssss> From the gorgeous opening grooves of ' Survival ' to the closing of ' Take A Bow ' , this record is all about substance . <sssss> Addressing her personal life in much the same way she did with LIKE A PRAYER , she not only tributes her mother on the beautiful ' Inside of Me ' , but snaps back at her critics with ' Human Nature ' , a biting and almost tongue-in-cheek take on what she thinks about said critics , proclaiming " Oops I did n't know I could n't talk about sex ... . Oops , I did n't know I could n't talk about YOU " . <sssss> It truly remains one of her most brilliant records , and was unjustly overlooked at radio . <sssss> All in all , an album that should go down as one of her masterpieces ( along with LIKE A PRAYER and RAY OF LIGHT ) .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000002MUW	4	Well , Madonna celebrates her self-worth here with hip-hop music . <sssss> Songs like Survival , Secret , Human Nature & Take A Bow talks about the loneliness of beng on top alone and resilience . <sssss> Although Madonna ai n't no hip-hop artist , she does a pretty good job here fusing the beats and rhythms into a cool R&B hip-hop album with the unmistakable Madonna sound ! <sssss> Working with Nellee Hooper ( Bjork 's producer ) , Dave Hall , babyface and Dallas Austin , Madonna displays her artistry in another genre of music but with pop sensibility . <sssss> EXCELLENT TRACKS include Human Nature , a song about Madonna having no regrets over the artistic choices she made ; Bedtime Story , a Bjork / Nelle Hooper electronica-trance hit , which was electronica b4 electronica was known ; Take A Bow , an Oriental-influenced Babyface-Madonna hit about fame and loneliness . <sssss> Anyway , many would have hated the frankness and the no-pushover overtones on this album , but what the hack , Madonna always opens the can of worms . <sssss> Listen to the album complete , it 's truly a story of Madonna from start to end .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B000002MUW	5	For awhile I was n't very interested in Madonna 's earlier albums , before she ventured off into electronica music . <sssss> I guess after listening to " The Immaculate Collection " I felt compelled to check out her other albums , and the first cd I picked up was " Bedtime Stories " . <sssss> Here on " Bedtime Stories " we get a brief glimpse of what to come with " Bedtime Story " a riveting techno-influenced tracked produced by Nellee Hooper who has worked with Bjork in the past . <sssss> In fact , the writing credits Bjork is listed as one of the writers of the song . <sssss> " Bedtime Story " is perhaps my favorite track off this cd , next to the more r & b influenced " Inside of Me " . <sssss> I never was fond of the remix of the track " Secret " but the original version I do like . <sssss> With Babyface and Dallas Austin as two of the producers of this album , " Bedtime Stories " has a overall r & b feel ( with the exception of " Bedtime Story " of course ) . <sssss> Yet another compelling album from Madonna .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B000002MUW	5	Bedtime Stories is one of Madonna 's best works ( alongside Erotica , Ray Of Light , Like A Prayer , etc ) . <sssss> This time Madonna goes R&B , and she does it very well . <sssss> Survival is a fun song , kind of autobiographical for Madonna about surviving despite what everyone puts against her . <sssss> Secret is the first single , with a sing along hook that you will always remember . <sssss> I 'd Rather Be Your Lover is a heavy R&B type song that will make you wan na dance , like Do n't Stop ( which in fact was a single on some radio stations that didnt want to play Human Nature ) . <sssss> Inside of Me is a lush ballad which is very dreamy . <sssss> Human Nature is the controversial song where Madonna faces her critics who are judgemental about everything she does . <sssss> Forbidden Love is a jazzy type song . <sssss> Love Tried To Welcome Me is another lush ballad and she sounds wonderful . <sssss> Santuary is another beautiful song where she sings very well , which leads into the title track Bedtime Story which is a preview in a way of things to come ( Ray Of Light ) , Bjork wrote this song and its the highlight of the album in my opinion . <sssss> The album closes with Take A Bow , a ballad in which Babyface wrote and lends his voice to . <sssss> Let Down Your Guard was the bside to Secret , and everyone says its a bad song but i like it . <sssss> Its a very R&B influenced song and its fun . <sssss> This album is basically a light headed fun album , with the occasional sad songs . <sssss> Its a great album and I highly reccomend it .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000002MUW	4	To be honest , this is actually my least favorite 90 's album of hers , but that does n't mean it 's not still great . <sssss> I think alot of fans needed an overall softer sound after " Erotica " . <sssss> Looking back , it seems like the hit " Take A Bow " was more popular than the album as a whole . <sssss> However this also gave us the hits " Secret " and " Human Nature " . <sssss> I tend to like other songs even more than those though , like " I 'd Rather Be Your Lover " , and the Bjork-written " Bedtime Stories " . <sssss> While most of the disc is very warm and ballad-heavy , a song like the title track shows where she was headed on the next album " Ray Of Light " . <sssss> Overall this album is a must for the major fan , but casual fans should be able to get by with " GHV2 " over this .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B000002MUW	3	I really did n't care for this album too much . <sssss> Once again , Madge teamed up with Shep Pettibone and even got Babyface into the act . <sssss> She was trying so hard to fit into that RandB / electronica thing that was going on in the mid-90s , but it just is n't Madonna . <sssss> Like I have said in other reviews , this is part of Madonna 's major transition period . <sssss> Like any of her other albums , there are some good tunes like SURVIVAL , SECRET , and I 'D RATHER BE YOUR LOVER . <sssss> But , I did n't think TAKE A BOW was all that ... . <sssss> and BEDTIME STORIES is good and ahead of its when it came out as a single ... but it got totally ignored for the most part ... or at least it seemed that way . <sssss> Madonna never does make a totally hideous album , nor can she seem to get it all just right . <sssss> She was heading in the overall right direction ... . <sssss> and her next albums were / and still are / celebrated gems . <sssss> If I had to pass over one album ... it would be this one . <sssss> You wo n't be missing much .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000002MUW	4	Madonna 's BEDTIME STORIES album was her answer to all the bad press her overlooked 1992 EROTICA album received . <sssss> " Human Nature " is her response to critics , a highlight from the album . <sssss> It 's a classic Madonna song in every sense . <sssss> She dumped Shep Pettibone on this album and worked with producers like Dallas Austin , Babyface , and more . <sssss> The sound leans itself mostly towards R&B , and it seems to work for the most part . <sssss> " Secret " was the first single , and a good hit for her . <sssss> " Survival " is a fun uptempo song about her survival in the music industry . <sssss> The title track is a great piece of music written by Bjork , but it was a little ahead of it 's time so it mostly was overlooked as a single and flopped . <sssss> The big hit from the album is the Babyface ballad " Take A Bow " . <sssss> There 's some nice ballads here like " Love Tried To Welcome Me " , " Inside Of Me " , and " Sanctuary " . <sssss> The only song that I ca n't enjoy is the inane " Do n't Stop " . <sssss> Overall not a bad album , but not great either .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000002MUW	5	After the controversial Erotica , Madonna returned two years later with her first ( and only ) venture into R&B . <sssss> She does it very well too . <sssss> Bounce along with the first track Survival , where Madonna laments on her career and how she 's survived , or the thumping I 'd Rather Be Your Lover . <sssss> The album also contains two of her biggest hits from the 90 's , the lush ballad Take A Bow , and the sing a long Secret . <sssss> Madonna pays homage to her critics in Human Nature , which is one of her shining moments in her entire career . <sssss> My favorite track is the Bjork written Bedtime Story , Madonna 's very first venture into the realm of techno music , excellent track . <sssss> The only filler I could find on this album was the song Do n't Stop . <sssss> Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary are some of Madonna 's most underrated songs . <sssss> This is a pleasant album to listen to , so give it a try !
A5889INEGKCQY	B000002MUW	3	In 1993 Madonna was a tabloids dream . <sssss> She had released her sex book and the album Erotica as well as the terrible film Body Of Evidence . <sssss> The girly show was a sucess however with all that it seemed that some people had gotten bit tired of Madonna and Erotica was a commercial disapointment . <sssss> Also many critics and journalist panned the sex book and Everything seemed to be falling down . <sssss> in 1994 she decided to put her clothes back on and she we n't into the studio to work on her next album . <sssss> Bedtime Stories is a R&B ; flavoured album . <sssss> It contains some hip hop tracks , some ballads and a bit of dance and one electronic trackBedtime Stories is musically great album however lyrically it can often be dull , self-indulgient and boring . <sssss> Her voice is sometimes streched to much and it sounds sometimes that she is not having fun while making this album and Madonna is a bit shallow at times especially on Human Nature were she adresses critics and people for not not liking the whole sex book thing . <sssss> Even though they have indeed right to have an opinion . <sssss> Bedtime Stories is also a bit dated . <sssss> You just know while hearing it that it was made 1993-1995 . <sssss> But as we come to the real deal and skip the flaws Bedtime Stories is enjoyable album . <sssss> It is soulful , danceable and the production and the arrangements are good . <sssss> Overall grade 7/10 . <sssss> stars
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000002MUW	4	this is the madonna cd to have from the 90 's . <sssss> it reminds me of her first one . <sssss> she sounds at ease working with dallas austin & babyface . <sssss> this disc has r-n-b all over it except for the bjork track which is unique in it 's own way . <sssss> this disc is far better than ray of light & erotica . <sssss> human nature is a great 2nd tier mary j. bliege track . <sssss> secret & take a bow hold up really well . <sssss> madonna sounds alright well as best as she can . <sssss> the production works rather well .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B000002MUW	5	Released some eleven years after her 1983 self-titled debut album , Madonna 's " Bedtime Stories " stanads as the singer 's transition from dance ingenue , of sorts , to a more mature artist . <sssss> The collection of songs features The Material Girl as a woman totally in charge of herself as a performer and as a poet of song . <sssss> There are the standard jams that harken back to her earlier stage of development ( " Do n't Stop " and " Bedtime Story " ) , but even they possess a mellower and slower tempo . <sssss> The tune " Sanctuary " gives a hint of Madonna 's future persona a la " Ray of Light " . <sssss> " Love Tried to Welcome Me " and " Take a Bow " , both co-written by Babyface , exhibit a depth of purpose and maturity that the singer would build upon in her award-winning ( and platinum-selling ) " Evita " . <sssss> Again , " Bedtime Story " is an essential in the singer 's lengthy discography , necessary for the fan as an example of the lady 's musical growth .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000002MUW	5	" Bedtime Stories " was Madonna 's follow-up to " Erotica " , an album so cooly received that it started a nasty backlash against the singer . <sssss> So , it 's not surprising that she comes across as a bit defensive on a couple of tracks : on " Survival " she promises that she 's " gon na be living to tell " and she lashes back at her critics in the dynamite " Human Nature " . <sssss> Elsewhere , " Bedtime Stories " was her most self-reflective album at the time , and it 's also her most r & b-sounding disc since her debut . <sssss> Dave Jam Hall , Dallas Austin and Babyface all supply the onetime Material Girl some solid beats and rhythms that would n't sound out of place on a Mary J. Blige album . <sssss> The hits , " Secret " and " Take a Bow " show up here , but other tracks of note are the infectious " Inside of Me " ( a tribute to her late mother ) and " Do n't Stop " , which should have been released as a single but was n't . <sssss> This album did n't flop upon release , but it sold less than it deserved to , mainly because people were looking for a " Vogue 2 " in this record . <sssss> Nonetheless , " Bedtime Stories " is a straight-up r & b record that deserves a second chance .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B000002MUW	5	Out of all of Madonna 's album I think that " Bedtime Stories " is most forgotten of all , but I ca n't understand why ? <sssss> On " Bedtime Stories " , Madonna take us into a kind of musicial dream , her dream , which is n't all that bad . <sssss> The first single " Secret " , went to # 3 and gave us another good Madonna song , I love the remix version of this song , although this is not one of my favorites of her , next came " Take A Bow " which hit # 1 and became Madonna 's longest # 1 hit staying at # 1 for 8 weeks , who would have known we would have to wiat 6 years for her next # 1 , but then came " Bedtime Story " , the title track which I think went over a lot of people 's head at the time this song only charted at # 42 , but gave us one of the most brillant videoes in the video era , and finally " Human Nature " , a payback song for those who critized her for her " Erotica " album and " Sex " book about taking things to seriously , this song gave us another classic video , but the song again landed outside the top 40 peaking at # 46 ? <sssss> , I just do n't understand ? <sssss> , out of all her album this I have to say honestly , is the one I have listened to the least , but I have listened to it enough that I can give it five stars , because it 's Madonna and you know it will be good , I think this is another album of hers where she just brings out great music and once again great writing . <sssss> Nice album Madonna .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B000002MUW	5	... my favorite Madonna CD to date . <sssss> It 's got that Dallas Austin/Babyface/Laface groove to it . <sssss> The ultra experimenter MeShell Ndege Ocello gives up the bass in that one tune " I 'd rather be Your Lover " and " Human Nature " has got ta be one of the Material Gurl 's phonkayist . <sssss> Love Bjork 's title track . <sssss> Like all good music , it stays with you after ' new music hype ' and the ' did you see the video ' fuss is long gone . <sssss> That 's what you should demand from your sounds .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000002NJS	5	Ray of Light is the best and most creative album by the Queen of Pop , all hail Madonna . <sssss> Her songwriting , her voice , and the music is amazing and inspiring here . <sssss> Gorgeous , full of life , and empowering . <sssss> All 13 tracks are great . <sssss> Sky Fits Heaven , " Traveling down this road watching the signs as I go ... " Frozen , " Love is a bird she needs to fly let all the hurt inside of you die ... " The Power of Good-bye , " I was your fortress you had to burn ... " Swim , " Children killing children while the students rape their teachers , comets fly across the sky while the churches burn their prechers " . <sssss> Little Star ( about her daughter ) , " God gave a present to me , made of flesh and bones ... " Mer Girl , " I ran from my house that can not contain me , from the man that I can not keep , from my mother who haunts me even though she 's gone , from my daughter that never sleeps " . <sssss> And so many more interesting tracks , Ray of Light won a Grammy for best Pop Album , much-derserved I think . <sssss> Producer William Orbit is a genius , he redefined Madonna 's sound into something more edgy and sophistcated as well . <sssss> Beautiful album from a beautiful and gifted woman .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B000002NJS	5	Five years ago , when I bought this CD , I was n't interested in techno . <sssss> Therefore , I was nervous about it . <sssss> I listened to it , and I was stunned ! <sssss> This is by far the best CD Madonna has recorded . <sssss> Her raw emotion is the key to its quality . <sssss> She begins " Ray of Light " with the emotional " Substitute For Love " . <sssss> This bold opener sets the theme to the album defining how she 's matured . <sssss> " Ray of Light " defines the entire genre of techno / dance . <sssss> " Ashanti " is a prayer that defines the entire kaballah religion with its intense spirituality . <sssss> " Little Star " proves that a lullaby can have techno sounds , which I 'm sure moved her daughter , Lola . <sssss> William Orbit is a genius producer . <sssss> I hope she works with him again . <sssss> If you 're into techno and unique music , " Ray of Light " should be on your wish list .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B000002NJS	5	Normally I 'm not a huge Madonna fan but when I first heard the title track on the radio prior to the release of this album , I knew I had to buy it . <sssss> I really like the direction Madonna went on this album . <sssss> William Orbit is a good match for her . <sssss> " Sky Fits Heaven " , " Nothing Really Matters " , " Ray of Light " , " Skin " , " Frozen " and " Power of Goodbye " are my all time favorite tracks . <sssss> William Orbit 's production is first class . <sssss> As a huge techno fan I was skeptical of Madonna experimenting with electronic music but after hearing " Ray of Light " all doubts were put to rest . <sssss> I still do n't think that this album is 100 % techno , just influenced by the genre . <sssss> Nevertheless this album is awesome I think .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B000002NJS	5	Madonna 's 1998 album Ray of Light was one of her best albums , not her best ( that honor goes to Erotica , her most complete album to date ) . <sssss> The album has an electronic feel to it , easily addictive with its textured background music and inspiring lyrics . <sssss> The album spawned 4 singles ( plus one in the UK ) . <sssss> Those included Frozen , the albums first single a wonderful ballad with haunting lyrics and music . <sssss> The A-side for Frozen was the indian inflenced Shanti / Ashtangi , another wonderful song . <sssss> The second single was the title track , one of the best songs on the album ( they are all gems ) its an upbeat song about how in life we move so quickly , yet live life to its fullest . <sssss> Its B-side was the non album track Has To Be . <sssss> The third US release was The Power of Goodbye , another fine ballad , and the A-Side was the haunting Mer Girl , where Madonna relives her mother 's death . <sssss> This is probably my favorite song on the album , because it tells such a story and makes you think . <sssss> I think it should of been a single personally but its not very commercial at all . <sssss> Nothing Really Matters was the final single , check out the remixes they are the best . <sssss> To Have and Not to Hold was the A-side . <sssss> Drowned World / Substitute for Love was a single only in the UK , it was released with remixes of Sky Fits Heaven . <sssss> This album is another fine addition to Madonna 's collection of wonderful music .
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B000002NJS	4	A great album . <sssss> Not only very danceable but also soothing and kinda spiritual as well . <sssss> The title track is very techno and was a big hit for her . <sssss> Some of the lyrics to the songs are kinda ' out-there ' . <sssss> Like " Candy Perfume Girl " for instance . <sssss> I ca n't make head nor tail out of them . <sssss> In fact a lot of her lyrics are like that . <sssss> It makes me wonder if I 'm missing a screw or I 've gone dyslexic or something . <sssss> But at least the music is great so it does n't matter so much . <sssss> In fact , " Shanti / Ashtangi " is sung in Sanskrit , and even though it has the English translation , I 'm darned if it makes sense . <sssss> But all in all , this is an album that most Madonna fans will love . <sssss> And 16 page booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B000002NJS	3	The " Mother Of Reinvention " reinvented herself noticeably for this album , but unfortunately , that 's not entirely a good thing in this case . <sssss> Not that it 's completely worthless ( the title track , the beautiful " The Power Of Goodbye " and " Little Star " are all nice offerings ) , but this overlong album is largely uncharacteristic for Madonna , lacking the all-out feelgoodness of her first 2 albums and the robust maturity of ones like " True Blue " and " Like A Prayer " . <sssss> Her average singing ability is not at its best here , much of the album is bland both musically and lyrically , and it 's filled with too many weird techno sounds that make it even more strange .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000002NJS	4	It may be hard to pick out " Madonnas " best album , but I think most would say this is her 90 's best . <sssss> Sure it 's another phase of hers and blah blah blah , but musically it 's very impressive , and her singing is also very strong . <sssss> And while the album is influenced by electronica , I never heard her say this was a techno album , so it should n't be judged as such . <sssss> Included are the hits " Frozen " , " Nothing Really Matters " , " Ray Of Light " , and the moving " Power Of Goodbye " . <sssss> Two other excellent songs are " Sky Fits Heaven " and " Drowned World / Substitute For Love " . <sssss> Most of the rest is good too . <sssss> I really like the " Erotica " and " Music " albums also , but neither is as satisfying as this . <sssss> It sounds as good as she looks on the cover .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B000002NJS	5	As some other reviewers have noted , Madonna was having a hard time in the early 1990s . <sssss> I think she was caught up in musical adolscence ( sp ? <sssss> ) . <sssss> But , when she emerged as an adult singer with RAY OF LIGHT , boy were we all blown away ! <sssss> This album is so great ! <sssss> FROZEN is one of the best songs ( and videos ) that Madonna has ever done . <sssss> Her music became so emotional and spiritual . <sssss> It 's like she finally found what she was hoping to find with EROTICA and BEDTIME STORIES , but just was n't mature enough to realize it then . <sssss> Another thing I think had a real effect on Madonna 's music was her having children and becoming a mother . <sssss> Many of her previous albums ( and even on AMERICAN LIFE ) have songs dealing with the loss of her mother at a young age . <sssss> I think Madonna found some kind of spiritual peace in having her own children . <sssss> To our delight , this made her an even better person ... . <sssss> and her music drastically improved . <sssss> Madge could finally enjoy making music ... be at peace ... and have a little fun . <sssss> If you have n't went out and purchased this yet ... you had better get to your local record store immediately ! <sssss> You wo n't want to miss this one !
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000002NJS	5	It seems this is Madonna 's last great album , well to me at least . <sssss> On 2000 's MUSIC she stumbled , and 2003 's AMERICAN LIFE she plummeted even further into the abyss . <sssss> On 1998 , she seems more focused than ever before on her music , which is more than I can say about her newer stuff . <sssss> This was one of the best era 's of her career , she truly made a huge comeback and impact with this album . <sssss> A lot happened between 1994 's BEDTIME STORIES and the release of this album in March of 1998 . <sssss> She starred as Evita Peron in EVITA in 1996 , and gave birth to daughter Lourdes in the same year . <sssss> Did motherhood change Madonna ? <sssss> Yes it did . <sssss> Working with producer William Orbit , the album has a sonically sweet sound that borrows heavily from electronica without overshadowing the poignant impact of the lyrics . <sssss> She sings about how she 's changed on " Drowned World / Substitute For Love " , " Nothing Really Matters " , and others . <sssss> " Swim " seems to be an epiphany about how she longs to be renewed and whole again . <sssss> She sings of motherhood on the lullaby-ish " Little Star " . <sssss> She tackles past demons about her own mother on " Mer Girl " , which is haunting and graphic . <sssss> " To Have And Not To Hold " is an excellent ballad , as is " The Power of Goodbye " . <sssss> Overall a strong collection of songs from the material mom .
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B000002NJS	4	One has the tendency to wax Madonna 's extraordinary CD " Ray of Light " as her foray into electonica , but no one should limit its provocativeness into such a narrow hold . <sssss> This collection does , indeed , encompass electronica 's aesthetic , but it 's a compendium of such raw emotion , mixed with melodies so fluid as to melt right into , that it takes the cold technicality of electronica and gives it life . <sssss> While treading such ground in the past [ Marvin Gaye 's " I Want You " cover , and the track " Bedtime Stories " ] , here she coheres full throttle , breathing new existence into drum and bass , rock and house and ambient and even an Asian mantra , while resurrecting a personal diary not seen since her masterpiece , " LikeA Prayer " almost a decade before . <sssss> Consider it the Mother of Re-Invention 's ' Sgt. <sssss> Pepper ' . <sssss> My grade : A -
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B000002NJS	3	Almost 2002 , Madonna Ciccone has had a baby , got married , released a funky album ( " Music " ) , got a video banned by MTV and VH1 ( 2001 's " What 's It Feels LIke For A Girl " ) , and went on a world tour ( her first since 1993 ) . <sssss> All these major events happenedjust a mere three years after the release of Madonna 's " Ray Of A Light " , the albumthat critics professed her greatest and the one for better or worse , Miss C. soundedthe most full of ( ... ) on. <sssss> I listened to " Ray Of LIght " around June ' 98-when the album 's jittery , groundbreaking videofor it 's title track was all over MTV-and kinda was confused . <sssss> Altought I absolutley loved theCD 's opener , " Drowned World / Substitute For Love " , a subtle yet not subtle Massive Attack-inspired medation on superstar rebirth . <sssss> I was loving it ( too bad the song 's video which mimicked Princess Diana 's last ride was never was never released in the US ) . <sssss> But at the time excludingthe radio-friendly cuts " Nothing Really Matters " and " The Power Of Goodbye " , " Ray Of Light " was n't my tribe . <sssss> Fast foward three years . <sssss> Here I am listening to " Ray Of Light " and really getting the feel ofthe songs . <sssss> It 's way better , now that my older ears hear it. <sssss> I still adore " Drowned World " but oneof the best has to be the delicate , folksy " Swim " , which has the Material Mother playing a technoSarah McLachlan . <sssss> " Frozen " and " Little Star " both got love this time around but if there was some-thing irratating on " Ray " is Madonna 's constant chamelon nature . <sssss> All throughtout the album Madonna 's gooey faux-spritual , English , techno moves come offas real as Kiss ' makeup . <sssss> It turns you off to see Madonna play a musical Mother Teresa then turn into a raunchy cowgirl two years later . <sssss> But hey , that 's just Madonna . <sssss> From a Christian vampto gold-toothed sex pony , Madonna changes images like underwear-for better or for worse . <sssss> " Ray Of Light " may not be wholly authenic but it has some nice moments . <sssss> But I say thatfor an above-average Madonna album peep " Music " - a funky cowride . <sssss> Without the fake British accent .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B000002NJS	5	20 years ago , a white girl with alot of soul broke into the music scene and changed the world with her music , style , and etc . <sssss> Very few gave her a chance to last 5 years , but today she is not only lasting ... she is making the BEST music . <sssss> Ray Of Light is hands down , one of the best and most creative albums I have ever heard . <sssss> THIS is what music should be about . <sssss> Growing , taking risks , experimenting and really caring about how your music will impact people . <sssss> My favorite song on this album is Sky Fits Heaven . <sssss> This song moved me to tears . <sssss> Other songs I like are Mer Girl , Candy Perfume Boy and Little Star . <sssss> At a time , when Michael Jackson has gone from cutting edge to scary , Janet Jackson from legit to bland and Whitney from excellent to sad , its so great to see there is still an artist that can progress . <sssss> I hope Christina A. follows Madonna 's examples .
A5889INEGKCQY	B000002NJS	3	When it comes to reviewing Madonna 's Ray Of Light it is hard to describe it . <sssss> What Madonna wanted to do is reinvent herself and make different kind of music . <sssss> She said she was a big techno fan but said also that many people did n't like techno becomes it was n't really emoitional and she said she wanted to make it emoitional . <sssss> It is nothing wrong with that but it fails to deliver the true emoitional part . <sssss> William Orbit is a great producer . <sssss> He remixed Justify My Love which could be found on her single . <sssss> ( She never mention it when they asked her why hireing William Orbit ) . <sssss> Now this album contains many Madonna 's hits and truly has some great tracks in between . <sssss> However some songs on Ray Of Light are fillers and others not so perfect . <sssss> The music often distracs Madonna 's voice and sometimes the opposite and when Madonna tries to be emoitional she ruins her songs with not so perfect lyrics ( she has written better lyrics before ) . <sssss> Her voice also does not seem to balance on the album and often the song that starts out really well becomes a big whole mess . <sssss> Though this album has some great kick ass tunes it has also some bad ones and not so good ones . <sssss> I Have to say that Ray Of Light by Madonna is probably her most overrated and overhyped work to date . <sssss> I Have listened to better albums but many Madonna 's fan seem to praise it . <sssss> Try Like A Prayer or Erotica instead .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B000002NJS	5	After practically having grown up to the music of Madonna , I was very used to the fact that she was the queen of Pop , but I would have never expected her to come up with such a brilliant dance / ambient album , like " Ray of Light " . <sssss> This time around , the diva counted with the production of William Orbit , considered precursor / father along with other greats ( such as Brian Eno ) of the Ambient musical movement . <sssss> As a result , the album stands out above all of Madonna 's previous work , as more soulful , more intimate , yet still retaining the essential Madonna feel to it : totally danceable and contagious . <sssss> Also to be considered as an element deeply affecting the quality of this album , is her motherhood , which becomes apparent in the more mature nature of the lyrics . <sssss> There 's not a single track on it I do n't like : it 's one of those perfect albums .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B000002NJS	5	When i was a kid I always tell people , I had three albums laying around , Ray of Light , Santana Supernatural , and Sugar Ray . <sssss> I listened to them over and over again . <sssss> Ray of Light is almost like a breath of fresh air . <sssss> It 's great , it really works for her voice . <sssss> It really show cases it . <sssss> It 's also very relaxing to listen to . <sssss> Frozen , is alittle slow , but great balled . <sssss> Nothing Really Matters great techo , and Ray of Light is a great pop song . <sssss> I can actually enjoy this whole album and like it . <sssss> This is really one of her best albums in my opinion .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B000002NJS	5	The deepest album of Madonna since " Like A Prayer " , Ray Of Light became the fresh air for an artist that had been in a battle downhill musicaly since " Erotica " , the flavor of this album is the same trough it all , deep lyrics with electronica sounds , the aproach of happiness in the world that surround you with fame are well crafted in the slow motion song " Drowned World " , the upbeat and uplifting should be rewarded to the greatest feeling provided by several tracks like " Ray Of Light " , " Nothing Really Matters " , " Skin " and " Sky Fits Heaven " , the beat ballads are represented by " Frozen ( dark and lovely ) " , " The Power Of Goodbye " and " To Have And Not To Hold " , Madonna portraits her new spirituallity in " Shanti " and her recent motherhood on " Little Star " , this is an album that will leave you in a magical place and is meant to be heard like a concept album , not like the way is in GHV2 , were the songs sound out of place , this is an amazing peace of art of the late 90 's an a reaffirmation of an artist that deserves to be called an Icon of Music .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000002NJS	5	What 's a woman to do ? <sssss> Madonna has worked with pop , house , r & b , VH1-ready ballads , and even hip hop . <sssss> Next to electronica , the only thing she has n't dabbled with is bluegrass ( not that I 'm waiting ) . <sssss> Four years since " Bedtime Stories " , she hooks up with remixer William Orbit for " Ray of Light " , which is no doubt one of her very best albums . <sssss> At the seasoned age of then 39 , it can be tricky to pull off electronica on record , but surprisingly her voice nicely matches Orbit 's synthetic production . <sssss> " Frozen " , " Ray of Light " , and " Nothing Really Matters " show Madonna at her most lyrically mature . <sssss> And the real showstopper is " The Power of Good Bye " , which could very well be Mrs. Ritchie 's best breakup song ever . <sssss> Musically , " Ray of Light " is one fun ride . <sssss> Orbit gives us discocentric , trance-like beats that highlight " Skin " and the dynamite stomper " Sky Fits Heaven " . <sssss> " Ray of Light " introduced to us a new Madonna , who smartly reinvented herself on this impressive record .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B000002NJS	5	Well like I have said before about Madonna albums , when I review them they get no less than 5 stars and " Ray Of Light " is definitely no different . <sssss> This prodecessor to the also excellent " Music " , does not disappoint , from the first release " Frozen " , we journey into Madonna 's journey on this album . <sssss> The title song and fast-paced " Ray Of Light " shows that Madonna can still dance and sing with the best of them . <sssss> Then we givin ' another A + ballad from Ms. M " The Power Of Good-Bye " just takes you breath away with the glorious and haunting lyrics . <sssss> And then the last single ( in the U.S. ) " Nothing Really Matters " which was sorely underappreciated shows Madonna in dance mode again . <sssss> There are also great non-released material such as " Sky Fits Heaven " and " Subsitute for Love " ( released only in the U.K. ) . <sssss> Once again on this album Madonna shows that she is in no way giving up .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B000002NJS	5	This album conjures a flood of wonderful memories for me . <sssss> On a car trip to Washington D.C. in March of 1999 , my best friend Rebecca and I listened to it about 50 times over the course of the weekend , and to this day I ca n't hear " Swim " without seeing the smile on Becky 's face as she exclaimed " I love this song " ! <sssss> From the stunning , emotional powerhouse of the opener " Drowned World / Substitute For Love " the album entrances you and literally envelops you in it 's beauty . <sssss> William Orbit manages to create brilliant , colorful and full soundscapes without overcrowding the tracks and always making certain that Madonna 's voice is front and center in the mix . <sssss> Some critics may argue that this album is not " techno " or " Euro " enough , but that would be quibbling . <sssss> This is obviously a very spiritual , personal and emotional release ( in every sense of the word ) for Madonna , and her heartfelt delivery on these songs is very telling . <sssss> Is it me , or does she sound like she 's near tears on " The Power Of Goodbye " , " To Have Not To Hold " and , my personal favorite , " Little Star " ? <sssss> There 's an air of sadness , loss and ultimately , rebirth looming over this entire CD and you may find it difficult to shake that feeling once you 've heard it . <sssss> But with music this beautiful , why would you want to ?
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B000002VT6	5	I am a fan of practically all types of music . <sssss> I listen to and love everyone from The Backstreet Boys and Mariah Carey to Sade and Enya . <sssss> Sarah Mclachlan 's " Surfacing " is a unique experience though compared to the rest . <sssss> practically every song is a gem . <sssss> The stand-outs are " Building A Mystery " , " Adia " , " Sweet Surrender " , and the underrated and beautiful " Do What You Have To Do " . <sssss> For a relaxing and beautiful experience , kick back and relax . <sssss> It 's almost impossible not to love this album and if you like this ( and do n't mind audience noise ) check out the equally wonderful " Mirrorball " which feautures songs from " Surfacing " and " Fumbling Towards Ectasy " . <sssss> Thanks for reading .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000002VT6	3	Surfacing by Sarah McLachlan is a mixed bag , some songs work and the rest do n't . <sssss> There are only 10 tracks but it 's a lovely collection of piano ballads but I have to admit Sarah 's voice does irritate me sometimes . <sssss> Tracks I do enjoy are Building a Mystery , Sweet Surrender , Angel , Full of Grace , and Do What You Have to Do . <sssss> The rest of the tracks are bit of a letdown especially the smash hit Aida , I could never get into that song ! <sssss> This is n't Sarah 's best album , I would recommend Afterglow instead .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B000002VT6	5	What a refreshing release from mainstream radio . <sssss> " I Love You " has got to be one of the most beautiful songs ever written , and " Black And White " has got to be one of the most affectuous most catchiest tunes on this planet . <sssss> Her vocal style is haunting and euphoric , lyrics cunning with the capacity of entwining your mind with your soul . <sssss> Many can relate to the meanings of her songs , like the sense of loneliness and / or heroin addiction she portrays with much oozing emotion on " Angel " . <sssss> It 's amazing how she can betray such intense feelings on " Possession " ( which you can find on her Fumbling cd . <sssss> ) and still captivate you with her disturbing message of a man gone obsessed . <sssss> She 's my all-time favorite singer and I hope that her creativity never wilts , which I 'm sure it wo n't . <sssss> From Touched to Surfacing she 's a true jewel to bestow upon . <sssss> So be my guest and feast on more recommendations , such as these other must-have 's by S.M : Touched ( 1989 ) , Solace ( 1991 ) , Fumbling Towards Ecstacy ( 1994 ) , Rarities , B-Sides & Other Stuff ( where you can find the chilling " Song For A Winter 's Night " ) , and Delerium 's Karma ( 1997 ) where you can find her breaking the " Silence " with sweet bliss . <sssss> I hope my review helped . <sssss> Did it ?
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B000002VT6	5	" Surfacing " is one of the most beautiful albums in Sarah McLachlan 's career . <sssss> This is less rock themed than her previous album " Falling Toward Ectasy " . <sssss> She sings her every drop of heart and soul through every track . <sssss> Her every track has heavy emotion that slams the listeners in a good way . <sssss> The spiritual " Angel " symbolizes this the most . <sssss> Her songwriting is amazing . <sssss> Every instrument combines with her beautiful soprano voice wonderfully , even the edgy electric guitar parts most expressed on " Witness " and " Black And White " . <sssss> Such combination heard on every track remains unique and ahead of its time . <sssss> McLachlan plays the guitar and the piano as soulfully as she sings . <sssss> She proves on " Surfacing " that she continues to evolve as a musician . <sssss> Such high level talent will give her legendary status in the following years to come . <sssss> This album is great for those looking for something unique and relaxing . <sssss> Many will be pleased .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B000002VT6	3	I 've been a huge Sarah McLachlan fan since " Touch " , long before the music industry took notice of her . <sssss> As good as as this cd is , " Solace " is far superior to " Surfacing " . <sssss> I did n't care for " Fumbling Towards Ecstasy " therefore I skipped on buying it . <sssss> I found it utterly useless to buy her live cd " Mirrorball " when I have the songs already , and secondly I hate live albums . <sssss> My one sole problem with this cd is that it comes off as schmaltzy with songs like " Angel " , which is a good song but too drippy . <sssss> With " Touch " and " Solace " there is melancholy and darkness in her lyrics and music that " Surfacing " fails to capture . <sssss> The production on the cd is a bit too polished but I can forgive Sarah for that . <sssss> I miss the starkness that " Vox " and " Path of Thorns ( Terms ) " has . <sssss> Overall I love this cd . <sssss> " Sweet Surrender " and " Adia " are two of my favorite songs , but " Angel " is my absolute favorite despite the drippiness in the lyrics . <sssss> " I Love You " is also a great song too .
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B000002VT6	5	Sarah has outdone herself on this album . <sssss> Her best album to date , every song is pure brilliance . <sssss> How is it possible for one person to be so talented ? <sssss> A singer/songwriter/guitarist / pianist , and good at them all . <sssss> I know there are others who can do all that too , but there is just something about Sarah that puts her above all the rest . <sssss> Or most of them , anyway . <sssss> Her voice and songs touch the soul ... like the beautiful ballads " I love You " and " Angel " . <sssss> Surely 2 of the most beautiful songs ever . <sssss> And this cd is enhanced with videos of her performing . <sssss> A real plus . <sssss> Sarah has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard ; she is so expressive and ethereal in her singing . <sssss> If you are a Sarah McLachlan fan and do n't yet have this album , what are you waiting for ? <sssss> Christmas ? <sssss> Well , that was yesterday , so wait no more . <sssss> And if you happen to be one of the few who do n't know of this talented artist yet ... <sssss> I have just 3 words ... BOXING WEEK SALES ! <sssss> ( Post-Christmas sales to you Americans ) .
A97B72F4UI8FA	B000002VT6	4	I was eager to get this cd . <sssss> I loved building a mystery but with the song Sweet Surrender i wanted this cd badly . <sssss> i am a big fan of up tempo music , but this cd is sometimes a little bit bland , but the great lyrics make up for it . <sssss> when Adia and Angel became two of her biggest hits ever , i was so happy . <sssss> No one should miss Sarah Mclachlan , she is a true genius . <sssss> but i reccomend Mirrorball-it has all her songs , and i think she is almost better live than in the studio .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B000002VT6	5	McLachlan is one of my favorites , not because I am bias , but because she proves herself time and time again . <sssss> All ten tracks on " Surfacing " are classics . <sssss> They are hazy love songs about frustration , loss , and deep love ( even the instrumental " Last Dance " is touching ) . <sssss> The music prefectly blends with her soft voice creating an atmosphere of thick that one can almost touch it . <sssss> Though it is hard to pick , " Building a Mystery " " Sweet Surrender " " Adia " " Do What You Have to Do " " Witness " and " Black and White " are the better half of the album , but there really is not reason to mention because they are all fabulous . <sssss> A must have for anyone with ears . <sssss> Dark love at its best .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B000002VT6	5	When you come across an album so good you have to review it . <sssss> Sarah Mclachlan finally got the recognition she truly deserved on " Surfacing " a wonderful collection of songs , on an album I listened to front to back . <sssss> " Building A Mystery " started this album off and became an instant hit ( even if it has a bad word in it ) becoming her first Top 10 hit , the came " Sweet Surrender " , an upbeat song for her , hitting # 28 , and giving us a personal view inside her mind , but the next two releases really put her in a class all her own . <sssss> " Adia " the album thire release was a phenonmenal hit for her giving her , her first top 3 hit also giving her a gold single the song went to # 3 , " Adia " is about someone Sarah never identifies . <sssss> And then comes " Angel " ( also on the " City Of Angels " soundtrack also good ) which once again hit the top 5 at # 4 , the video is a simple live video , but the song that makes this album also glow is " Last Dance " a song so beautiful it needs no words . <sssss> I became more of a fan by listening to this album but also because Sarah has a very unique voice , and she sond incredible live .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00000DFRS	3	It 's no classic but it 's good enough . <sssss> My favorites are : It 's Not Right But It 's OkayI Was Made To Love HimIf I Told You Thatand Until You Come Back . <sssss> I like the beat to Oh Yes and have grown to like the song . <sssss> Until You Come Back , written by Babyface himself is also notable . <sssss> I Was Made To Love Him is good too . <sssss> It 's a very bouncy track . <sssss> I do n't care too much for You 'll Never Stand Alone though .3.8 stars . <sssss> Good CD but I 'm sure that one of her earlier releases is better . <sssss> But if you enjoy R&B ; , then I fully recommend this CD .
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B00000DFRS	4	Whitney Houston 's sad passing in February 2012 , following more than a decade of personal downfall , had left a considerable body of work , although she was not as prolific as she might have been . <sssss> This had one big reason ; the 1992 soundtrack " The Bodyguard " , which sold well over 20 million copies ; before that , she released three regular albums , of which the last , " I 'm Your Baby Tonight " , was rather weak . <sssss> After " The Bodyguard " , two more soundtracks of the artist 's starring movies followed . <sssss> However , fans had to wait until late 1998 for her next proper longplayer . <sssss> It was worth the wait . <sssss> With modern r & b ; , rap , neo-soul and hip-hop raging around at the end of the millennium , Houston left nothing to the chance and summoned a legion of trendy producers beginning with Rodney Jerkins , Missy Elliott and Wyclef Jean and ending with adult contemporary stalwarts Diane Warren and Babyface . <sssss> Especially the whopping title track penned by Wyclef Jean entered the anals of sleek , immaculately produced pop-music , as did the US-high-charting " Heartbreak Hotel " featuring Kelly Price and Faith Evans . <sssss> The record also includes the Oscar winning duet with rival Mariah Carey ( " When You Believe " from " The Prince of Egypt " ) and Rodney Jerkins ' helmed " If I Told You That " , later redone as a duet with George Michael . <sssss> Even the then-much-hyped Lauryn Hill was enlisted for the last moment , producing the closer " I Was Made To Love Him " . <sssss> Here , as well as on Missy Elliott 's " In My Business " , lyrics were hintng at the singer 's unending love for husband Bobby Brown , although the reality of her life was just at the time of this release starting to enter darkness of drugs , alcohol and domestic abuse . <sssss> In the final analysis , " My Love Is Your Love " not only can be called the last great album of Whitney Houston in terms of vocal performance . <sssss> It may eventually be ackowledged as her best - certainly her most consistent - regular album ever .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00000DFRS	5	Long accused of so-so music that did n't live up to her glorious voice , Whitney Houston all but silenced critics with this career album , 13 years into said career . <sssss> After attempting to ditch the slightly white-bread sound of her first two discs , her last studio effort , I 'M YOUR BABY TONIGHT , came off as slightly uneven and just a little disjointed , and as such was for the most part , with the exception of a couple of hits , met with apathy . <sssss> Fast forward eight years , and an album no one suspected she had in her . <sssss> Granted , the signature power ballads are here , but she 's also injected a shot of slinky pop / R & B , thanks in large part to Rodney Jerkins string-drenched production . <sssss> The resulting work , which includes ' It 's Not Right But It 's Okay ' , remains creative zeniths for both Houston and Jerkins . <sssss> Babyface and David Foster also contribute tracks , along with uber-writer Diane Warren , whose work is usually beyond saccharine but in Houston 's hands manages to rise above the typically insipid lyrics . <sssss> A must for any pop fan , and Houston 's most essential recording to date .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00000DFRS	5	Whitney 's first album in 8 years . <sssss> Wow , first one since Im Your Baby Tonight ( 1990 ) . <sssss> After a slew of successful movies she returns to the recording studio for a full album , this one called My Love Is Your Love . <sssss> With a slew of guest artists and producers , this is one of her best albums yet . <sssss> The album spinned off many hits such as Its Not Right But Its Okay ( the remix is better ) , Heartbreak Hotel with Kelly Price & Faith Evans ( a very soulful R&B song , youll love it ) , My Love Is Your Love ( with Wyclef , a very touching song I love it ) , When You Believe ( with Mariah Carey , its a really good song and they both sing so well , should of done way better than it got credit for ) , I Learned From The Best ( one of three tracks penned by Diane Warren , produced by David Foster ) . <sssss> However there is so much more on this album . <sssss> Missy Elliot lends her talent to the hip hop song In My Business , If I Told You That is a funky R&B tune which was later rerecorded for her Greatest Hits album this time with George Michael lending vocals , but this is just as good . <sssss> Oh Yes tends to be a little over polished but still nice . <sssss> Get It Back is a really funky R&B tune youll love dancing to , Until You Come Back is the power ballad of the cd youll love , I Bow Out is another fun song as well . <sssss> The album closes with two last tracks , the wonderful Youll Never Stand Alone which is almost the predeccor of You Were Loved , and the album closes with a R&B song with Lauryn Hill called I Was Made To Love Him . <sssss> This is a really good album with some good music , youll like it just give it a listen .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B00000DFRS	5	This was Whitney Houston 's first album in 8 years . <sssss> She did a lot of movie and soundtrack work in the 90s , most notably THE BODYGUARD , but this was her official follow up to 1990s IM YOUR BABY TONIGHT . <sssss> I believe this is her strongest effort to date . <sssss> There is n't a weak track in the bunch . <sssss> Whitney worked with a lot of contemporary producers at the time , like Missy Elliott , Wyclef Jean , Lauryn Hill , Rodney Jerkins , and more . <sssss> The album opens with the anthem " It 's Not Right But It 's Ok " . <sssss> The album version is good , but the remix is even better . <sssss> " Heartbreak Hotel " is a showstopping performance by Whitney , Faith Evans and Kelly Price . <sssss> The title track is the song that Wyclef Jean produced . <sssss> " When You Believe " is a nice duet with Mariah Carey , they compliment each other well . <sssss> These 4 songs were singles from the album in the US , and the Diane Warren penned " I Learned From The Best " was also a single . <sssss> I like the Missy produced tracks , " In My Business " and " Oh Yes " , the latter being a perfect piece of soul . <sssss> There 's some good uptempo R&B on songs like " If I Told You That " , " I Bow Out " and " Get it Back " . <sssss> She collaborates with Lauryn Hill on the hidden track " I Was Made To Love Him " , which is nice . <sssss> One of my favorites is the inspiring ballad " You 'll Never Stand Alone " . <sssss> Overall this is a top grade effort from Mrs. Bobby Brown , worth repeated listens .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B00000DFRS	5	When a cd wins several awards or sells millions of copies does n't mean that it 's the best work of a singer . <sssss> " My love is your love " is one of Whitney 's latest albums and for me it 's her best . <sssss> This production did n't have the impact of " The bodyguard " or her 1987 hit release " Whitney " but it also had a good experience on the charts . <sssss> It was a Top 15 album , sold 5 million copies worldwide and its singles ; " It 's not right but it 's ok " , " My love is your love " , " I learned from the past " and the biggest one , " Heartbrake hotel " next to Faith Evans and Kelly Price were hits . <sssss> There 's also a duet with Mariah Carey . <sssss> The song is the theme from " The Prince of Egipt " that was nominated for an Oscar in the Best song for a movie category , back in 2000 . <sssss> This album was considered as Whitney 's comeback ( it was actually her first new studio album after her 1990 " I 'm your baby tonight " ) and it had a different direction . <sssss> Whitney adds more hip-hop sounds .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00000DFRS	4	This cd arrived after 8 long years since her last studio album , " Im Your Baby Tonight " . <sssss> Afterwards Whitney went on to act in some movies , this was her celebrated return . <sssss> My Love Is Your Love is a collection of contemporary R&B music . <sssss> Working with producers such as Rodney " Darkchild " Jerkins , David Foster , Missy Elliott , to name a few , Whitney turns in some exciting music with this album . <sssss> Diane Warren penned a few of the tracks too . <sssss> The first single " When You Believe " is a duet with Mariah Carey , which I found to be underrated . <sssss> The next single " Heartbreak Hotel " performed better on the charts , a song with Kelly Price and Faith Evans , one of the most compelling R&B tracks with true emotion that has been missing from the genre for quite some time . <sssss> " It 's Not Right But It 's Okay " is a good song , but the remix on radio and in the video is much better than the one that appears in this album . <sssss> " My Love Is Your Love " is a beautiful song written by Wyclef Jean which is truly a highlight of the album . <sssss> Along with the singles , there is definately some excitement to talk about . <sssss> " You 'll Never Stand Alone " is Whitney 's most compelling and beautiful ballads since 1996 's " You Were Loved " , truly inspiring . <sssss> " Until You Come Back " is a classic Whitney ballad . <sssss> " In My Business " is a song where Whitney wonders why people are all hatin her and up in her business , with Missy on the side to add extra flava . <sssss> Overall Whitney has turned in a fairly good collection of contemporary R&B . <sssss> Some would say she jumped on the bandwagon , but listening to this clearly showcases her ability to do various types of music .
A149OQJD0ASI07	B00000DFRS	4	Okay , so by now , Mrs. Brown 's personal demons and public struggles are no secret . <sssss> And at press time , she was still off her game so to speak though I 'm sure loyal fans truly hope she 's able to clean herself up and get back on track . <sssss> The only thing you need to know about this album is that Whitney sounds like Whitney ( before drug use surely led to much weaker and more pitiful subsequent releases ) . <sssss> The " Whitney of Old " could go toe-to-toe and pretty much outsing any and all of the popular singers of her day : Ma Donna , Teena Marie , Janet Jackson , Anita Baker , Stephanie Mills , Mariah Carey , Toni Braxton , Mary J. Blige , Faith Evans , Brandy , Monica , Aaliyah , Kelly Price , Christina Aguilera , Celine Dion . <sssss> If you 've heard or already own Whitney 's classics like her self-titled debut ( ' 85 ) , Whitney ( 1987 ) and the smash-hit soundtracks to The Bodyguard ( ' 92 ) and the Preacher 's Wife ( 1996 ) , then " My Love Is Your Love " is an album worth purchasing or at least giving a listen because of Whitney 's awesome vocal abilities . <sssss> This is indeed another strong album she made before falling off vocally and as an entertainer . <sssss> Recommended purchase .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00000DFRS	5	" My Love Is Your Love " is the album Whitney should have been making all these years , from the days when she released big , soaring ballads that rivaled Mariah Carey 's in the schmaltz department . <sssss> But on this album , we get slammin grooves , mainly produced by Rodney Jerkins . <sssss> " It 's Not Right , But It 's Okay " could very well be Whitney 's best single ever ( and the Thunderpuss remix is even better ) ; it 's an assertive , self-confident number about walking out of a dead-ended relationship . <sssss> " If I Told You That " ( which would later feature George Michael on the grestest-hits disc ) also shines , and Wyclef Jean gives the album a welcome reggae lilt on the beautiful title track . <sssss> My cut of choice , however , is a song that was n't even released : " Get it Back " . <sssss> Even the Diane Warren-penned " I Learned from the Best " is also pretty good ( which is really saying something ) . <sssss> Only towards the end of the album do we get a couple of subpar tunes . <sssss> Nevertheless , this album finally made it cool to like Whitney , and I strongly recommend this CD .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B00000DFRS	5	You 've heard many of the cuts from this , Whitney 's latest album . <sssss> You 've probably read many of the reviews below . <sssss> And you 've probably seen all the vids ... what 's next is the Grammies . <sssss> This album has been nominated in several of the Grammy R&B categories ... Whitney is bound to come out with more than a few of the awards . <sssss> I liked " HeartBreak Hotel " when I first heard it 'cause it showcases all three vocalists individually and collectively -- they meet somewhere near the end with duelling vocal arpeggios so much so that the listener is not sure he is hearing Whitney imitating Kelly Price or Kelly Price doing a Faith Evans or Faith posing as Whitney . <sssss> ( You do n't believe me ? <sssss> Listen and try to determine for yourself . <sssss> ) " It 's Not Right , But It 's OK " has some of the best vocalising in years done by any female singer -- Whitney is supple , near conversational during the verses , but showing some sinew during the adlibs and vamp -- that last two lionine " Oh " s are simply thrilling . <sssss> Like something seen from her pal Chaka Khan ... <sssss> Ya got ta have a Whitney power ballad or two on Whitney 's CDs . <sssss> I also adore Mariah Carey , so this duet from the " Prince Of Egypt " was right up this poor boy 's alley ... . <sssss> I am so unworthy , my goddesses . <sssss> Anyway , like I said , look for Whitney to bring home some golden gramophones with this album . <sssss> And that , my friends , is the unvarnished truth ...
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00000DGUG	5	Alanis Morissette 's most under-rated masterpiece , Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is her finest and complex work . <sssss> A very moody album , very saracastic , cynical , but does have moments have passion and self-awarness . <sssss> Alanis is one brainy woman , her lyrics are incredible , top-notch and cool . <sssss> Standout tracks include : Front Row , Joining You , I was Hoping , U R , Ca n't Not , Would Not Come , Are you still Mad ? <sssss> , Unsent , and So Pure . <sssss> Alanis did n't even want to record another record after the huge success of Jagged Little Pill , her success over-whelmed her and left the songtress empty and exhausted from supporting and touring with the album . <sssss> Producer Glen Ballard and her friends finally convinced Alanis to record again and ever since that moment she has never stopped creating positive and great music . <sssss> A perfect album , 17 tracks , boy that 's a lot . <sssss> Hear this album when you 're feeling down , it will make you feel more alive and human afterwords . <sssss> Powerful words from a powerful woman , Alanis rocks !
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B00000DGUG	4	After the celebrated , but uneven and very angry " Jagged Little Pill " , Alanis Morrissette in 1998 released her most diverse and , put simply , best record yet . <sssss> On " Junkie " , teaming again with producer Glen Ballard , Alanis is more mature and less militant than on " Pill " , sophisticatedly improving her songwriting qualities , while providing more glimpses to her complicated personality . <sssss> Generous in offering 17 songs , some of this rock album 's are outright gems ( " Unsent " , " Joining You " ) , some show really eclectic taste ( " Thank You " , " So Pure " ) . <sssss> Failures can also be found , mainly " Sympathetic Character " with its meaningful message but , alas , with completely inadequate musical side . <sssss> Guitars are dominating , often with impressive results ( " Baba " , " Ca n't Not " , " Would Not Come " ) . <sssss> Morissette 's traditionally overlapping lyrics sometimes work out right ( " The Couch " ) , sometimes not ( " Your Congratulations " ) . <sssss> " One " and " UR " are plain good songs , as is " That I Would Be Good " , which seems to be tapping from the roots of Alanis ' great compatriot Sarah McLachlan . <sssss> Sophomore efforts seldom exceed the quality of debuts ( " Jagged Little Pill " is usually considered Morissette 's real debut ) . <sssss> " Junkie " did , although the sales did not indicate that . <sssss> The problem was that " Junkie " lacked the hype of " Pill " , enhanced by the handful of Grammies . <sssss> That 's usual music irony .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00000DGUG	4	After the hugely successful " Jagged Little Pill " , Alanis brings out her sophmore release in 98 , " Suppossed Former Infactuation Junkie " with the desire to not just please her fans but to please herself as well . <sssss> After endless touring she begun a battle within herself - questioning whether or not singing was what she really wanted to pursue for the rest of her life . <sssss> She could have stopped when she was on top but instead decided to stick the gut . <sssss> I am so tired of everyone bickering about how this album is a failure for Alanis Morissette . <sssss> In her debut album she gripes and complains too much while here she blesses the listener with a much more conciliatory approach , though still a bit disturbed . <sssss> She also seems to feel more comfortable in her skin , seeing that instead of dressing the " grunge look " she appears nearly naked in her video for Thank U as well as the CD 's disk cover . <sssss> And instead of infusing pure rock elements she also experiments more on ambient and electronic sounds , giving her the rightful niche of Pop Rock ... <sssss> Probably the most obvious restrain on a softer advance is on track # 6 , That I Would Be Good , which features a delicately touched piano and her take on the flute and harmonica . <sssss> And despite her often flat and off-keyed notes it somehow adds more beauty to the otherwise monotonous song ... Other favorites include the more synthesized and programmed tracks such as Baba , Front Row , The Couch , Ca n't Not , I Was Hoping , One , Would Not Come , and Joining You . <sssss> I did give this 4-stars , though , just because songs like Unsent and Your Congratulations bore me to tears . <sssss> I still find this required listening , though , and suggest that once her forthcoming album , " Under Rug Swept " comes out that you see her on tour . <sssss> I actually just recently had the opportunity to catch her live and be one of the first to hear exclusive songs from that album , and let me tell you - they sound incredible .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00000DGUG	4	Alanis ' second album has a longer title and is longer too , with 17 songs and many words in between . <sssss> Clearly , Alanis breaks new ground with this album and it 's not meant to be Jagged Little Pill Part 2 . <sssss> While Pill relies mainly on female angst that blows out of proportion , Junkie talks about reconciliation and acknowledgement . <sssss> From the splendid Front Row to the appreciative Thank You , Alanis demonstrates a maturity that 's more evident here . <sssss> She and producer , Glen Ballard mix in some fast-tempo elements ( I Was Hoping / So Pure ) and the result is vastly different from Pill . <sssss> Several songs are touchingly beautiful . <sssss> Are Still You Mad asks if Alanis ' ex was still mad with her for lashing out . <sssss> That I 'll Be Good is haunting . <sssss> The best of all is Unsent , a series of letters that Alanis wrote but never sent to her ex-lovers . <sssss> The words might be long and sometimes too relevant , but Alanis ' strength lies in her delivery and her ear for great melodies . <sssss> Though the album didnt sell like her debut , it certainly was her best yet then . <sssss> There will still be cynical critics out there trying to hold her down but Junkie is a step to silencing them , but why does Alanis care anyway ?
A2BO41VARYGTAC	B00000DGUG	5	I must admit that when I first heard this album I was shocked . <sssss> I really did n't like it and thought it was awful . <sssss> But , I always like to give things a chance , so I listened more . <sssss> And now I have to say that it is one of my favourite albums . <sssss> I also think that the majority of poor ratings for this album are from people who have only listened to it one or two times . <sssss> It really is an album that grows on you , and eventually you will realize that it is a work of genius . <sssss> It has depth and character and many different layers . <sssss> It is very different to her first album , but give it a chance and you could very well end up loving it too .
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B00000DGUG	1	Baby , all you 're diary entries ca n't be songs ! <sssss> Alanis is surely one of the most pretenious,boring,annoying,andself-absored women in pop . <sssss> No substance and no sense of humor . <sssss> Howin the world does this woman sell records ? <sssss> Does Madonna and the folks at Maverick persaude Madonna 's huge fanbase to buy it or something ? <sssss> I 'm not trying to down all of Alanis ' fans because like another pretenious , dull singer / songwriter I dislike Tori Amos a lot of people have healed to her music . <sssss> This is n't a diss to Alanis ' fans but to Alanis herself . <sssss> Hey , since she 's so self-important maybe she 'll take a trip to India ( which inspriredthis album 's first single " Thank U " ) again and she 'll become so " inspired " that she 'll quite singing and I do n't know ... write a book . <sssss> Yeah do that Alanis , anything to stop you from making records !
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00000DGUG	5	Fans did n't really embrace this album , it was viewed as a disapointment in the shadow of JAGGED LITTLE PILL . <sssss> I personally love this album , as it offers something completely different and unexpected from Alanis . <sssss> This album is about her spiritual awakening and growth as a person . <sssss> The songs have a certain rawness and emotion to them which is just captivating . <sssss> My personal favorite is " That I Would Be Good " which is one of her more endearing songs in my opinion . <sssss> The songs are written in an intriguing way , they are very interesting , such as " The Couch " which seems to be about a patient under a psychiatrist who is remembering his / her problems . <sssss> The first single " Thank U " is an excellent song about what Alanis has learned in the years she was gone , and where she 's been . <sssss> " Unsent " offers an interesting take on a song , its a compilation of love letters Alanis never sent . <sssss> Elsewhere this cd has other shining moments , such as " I Was Hoping " , " So Pure " , " Joining You " and " Sympathetic Character " , although there 's not one filler track to be found . <sssss> So I would suggest if you are adament about this , to just listen to it as it is , and not think of it as the follow up to JLP , this one its own masterpiece .
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B00000DGUG	5	Alanis ' first cd , " Jagged Little Pill " , was definately a hard act to follow . <sssss> However , with her latest cd , Alanis Morissette proves she 's here to stay . <sssss> Her words are beautiful and it 's as though she 's talking to the listener . <sssss> Alanis has a tremendously beautiful and expressive voice , and " Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie " proves it . <sssss> For a deep and introspective album , purchase Alanis Morissette 's latest release now .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00000DGUG	5	For the longest time I could n't get past the astounding power of " Baba " , which still stands as my favorite track from this 1998 release . <sssss> A brilliant jab at fake prophets and the weaklings who follow them , this gem of a hard rocker is the most genuinely heavy-handed piece of music Alanis has ever produced . <sssss> Over a tight rhythm arrangement , brilliant guitar voicings on the verses ( I just LOVE the wall of feedback and sqealing high notes after the first chorus ) and open-tuned power chords of the choruses , Morrisette sings in a deeper , world weary drone ( especailly effective on the line " ... upward glances in hope of instant salvation " ) that will stun listeners with it 's newfound maturity and soul . <sssss> This is only one of dozens of great moments scattered throughout " Supposed Former .... " that will have you addicted . <sssss> " Thank You " just gets prettier and more poignant with the passing of each year , and " Are You Still Mad " ? <sssss> remains a great ' get over it ' song for the ages . <sssss> Of course , this did n't sell as well as " Jagged Little Pill " but is ultimately the more rewarding album . <sssss> A fine , personal and mature work that keeps getting better .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B00000IAU3	4	This is one of those albums that deserved to sell millions of copies . <sssss> I understand why so many people compare her to Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O'Connor , but that is n't a bad thing at all . <sssss> Would you rather hear someone who sounds like those two great artists or someone who sounds like the latest cookie cutter teen pop tart ? <sssss> Dido 's voice is not interchangeable with most of what 's out there right now , and that 's what I like about her .1 ) Here With Me : this song never gets old . <sssss> It 's one of my favorite songs on the album .2 ) Hunter : a really good song . <sssss> She sounds really good here .3 ) Do n't Think of Me : could have been a really big hit . <sssss> She nails this song .4 ) My Lover 's Gone : very cool song . <sssss> I really like it .5 ) All You Want : worth the price of the CD alone . <sssss> I like the little twist at the end .6 ) Thank You : this song was deservedly a big hit . <sssss> Somehow I never got sick of it .7 ) Honestly OK : another really good song .8 ) Slide : I like this song a lot . <sssss> It is very good .9 ) Isobel : she finds an interesting way to sing about a controversial topic . <sssss> It 's a good song .10 ) I 'm No Angel : I like this song . <sssss> It is a good song for her .11 ) My Life : one of my favorites . <sssss> She sounds really good here .12 ) Take my Hand : another great song . <sssss> It could have been a big hit . <sssss> You ca n't go wrong with this album . <sssss> It is very good and it 's about as good as debut albums get .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00000IAU3	3	Like most people , I first heard Dido when her infamous verse from " Thank You " was used as the chorus for Eminem 's " Stan " . <sssss> I do n't really think people were paying attention to her when she dropped " Here With Me " , but after the full-length " Thank You " came out , it became a hit , and people then started buying the album . <sssss> Dido has a good voice for her music , and as I look at her material , I think that in time she may be able to reach Tori Amos levels of stardom . <sssss> But I 'm not necessarily comparing her to Tori because Dido 's songs are more accessible . <sssss> There are a lot of good songs on here like " Do n't Think Of Me " and " My Lover 's Gone " , as well as " Thank You " and " Here With Me " . <sssss> I 'm not sure if I 'm completely feeling " Slide " ; also , I think " All You Want " and " I 'm No Angel " could have been rewritten a few times . <sssss> But this is still a good album . <sssss> Whenever Dido releases a new album , I 'll pick it up .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00000IAU3	4	How does that old adage go -- good things come to those who wait ? <sssss> That would certainly be the case with Dido . <sssss> I remember the first time that I heard ' Here With Me ' -- long before it was ROSWELL 's theme song -- on a modern rock station in ' 99 , and thought , what a cool song . <sssss> Too bad it took Eminem sampling ' Thank You ' to make people sit up and take notice -- this album is deep with great music . <sssss> Her voice is very reminiscent of Ruth-Ann 's ( from the group Olive ) , and her music is somewhat along the lines of Sarah McLachlan , only slightly less pretentious . <sssss> A very strong effort .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B00000IAU3	5	Dido 's " No Angel " combines pop , alternative , and Celtic to creative this amazing unique sound . <sssss> Her voice is mindblowing . <sssss> She allows the audience to feel her emotions through her instrument , whether it 's heartbreak , love , loneliness , or longing . <sssss> Her lyrics are written very close to her heart . <sssss> No drop of emotion is ever held back . <sssss> Her stand-out tracks are " Here With Me " ( from the former TV show " Roswell " ) and the smash hit " Thank You " ( first heard on Eminem 's " Stan " ) . <sssss> The album listened in whole give the audience an unforgettable heartfelt journey . <sssss> Such talents prove that she is one of the best artists of today , and that she 'll continue to entertain the world for many more years .
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B00000IAU3	4	Eminem did us a lot of good by bringing this talented singer / songwriter to the forefront via a sample in his " Stan " single . <sssss> It had n't been the first time I 'd heard Dido , but it was the Eminem single that prompted me to get the No Angel album , and I 'm glad I did . <sssss> Dido 's unique vocal style -- self-conscious phrasing , semi-cool , at times recalling Suzanne Vega and at others Edie Brickell -- takes a lot of getting used to , but her melodies are full-force . <sssss> Just the mighty chorus to " Do n't Think of Me " is deserving of applause , and it 's to her credit that Dido somehow manages emotional expression with her fairly detached , whisper-light voice . <sssss> The dense wall-of-sound arrangements help , and though sometimes the album waxes a bit techno sounding , there 's usually enough warmth and humanity in the sonics to make you want to keep listening . <sssss> Looks like Dido wo n't follow the footsteps of her Roman-myth namesake -- even if Eminem turned out to be her Aeneas , this Dido does n't seem to need him for much longer ; she sounds well over strong enough to excel on her own .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00000IAU3	4	Well a little help from Roswell and Eminem is really good . <sssss> Dido should have stood out on her own and though it took a while for the buying public to take to her music , it 's catching on rite now especially with Stan by Eminem being released . <sssss> While u hear Eminem sampling parts of Thank You by Dido , the original is poignant song . <sssss> The song was also featured on Gwyneath Paltrow 's Slidin Doors years ago . <sssss> Other faves include Honestly Ok and the bonus track Take My Hand . <sssss> Dido sometimes sounds like Sarah McLachlan and exudes the same quality too . <sssss> But she holds well on er own , no less . <sssss> Excellent debut waiting to be discovered , more !
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00000IAU3	3	As much as I love this album , I find myself annoyed hearing " Here With Me " everywhere I go . <sssss> How many times must Hollywood use this song for their tv / movie soundtracks ? <sssss> There are other great songs on the No Angel cd but for some strange reason all I hear is " Here With Me " on the radio . <sssss> I really do n't care for how the highly overrated rapper Eminem could butcher a song like " Thank You " for his song " Stan " . <sssss> The original is a lovely song and should have been left alone to begin with . <sssss> " Do n't Think of Me " is probably my favorite track on the whole cd . <sssss> I am eager to hear what her next album will sound like in the near future . <sssss> Dido definitely has shown her potential with No Angel and on a few tracks of her brother 's band Faithless cds . <sssss> I think she will be around for a long time to come .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00000IAU3	5	I first heard the song " Here With Me " from " Roswell " ... . <sssss> my favorite tv show ... . <sssss> which has no bearing to the music ... <sssss> So I tried to find who sang this song ... first I thought it was Sarah McLachlan , so I sampled every song of hers on Amazon , could n't find it ... then I looked for all the " Roswell " sites and finally found who did the theme , I bought the CD , and it was absolutely fantastic ... of course I am partial to the first song , but the rest of the CD is Fab u lous ... . <sssss> Dido has a beautiful voice , and honestly I feel she edges Sarah out in the music department ! <sssss> An absolutely beautiful CD !
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B00000IAU3	4	I suspect this debut is something she will always have a hard time matching , because it 's so good , and it seems to really touch alot of people . <sssss> Dido says that she makes music that she wants to hear , and she 's clearly not alone . <sssss> I think this appeals to so many people because the music is a mesh of pop , folk , and electronica , and of course the voice and the lyrics are a plus too . <sssss> " Here With Me " is a popular favorite and good opener , and no matter how many times I hear " Thank You " , I always love it . <sssss> That song just puts me into a trance . <sssss> The rest is all very good , and it all leads up to my favorite song " Take My Hand " . <sssss> It starts very mellow , and builds up to a great beat , and is really quite an emotional and lengthy bonus track . <sssss> So I say that a day without " No Angel " would be hell .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00000IAU3	4	Dido 's case reminds me a lot of Jewel in more than one respect . <sssss> She 's a fabulous female composer and singer , to begin with . <sssss> But most important of all , she rose to true fame almost two years after the release of this her debut album , ' No Angel ' ( 1999 ) . <sssss> As for comparisons ( they 're inevitable in today 's crowded arena of female vocalists ) the style of the sister of Rollo ( leader of Faithless ) stands somewhere next to Natalie Merchant , Alanis Morrisette and Sarah McLachlan . <sssss> Contrary to popular belief , the single " Thank You " exhausted now after so much airtime , and a very popular version of it made in collaboration with Eminem is far from being the best track in the album . <sssss> The opening track ( " Here with me " ) exhibits an unusual force , and the softer tunes , " My Lover 's Gone " , " Slide " , and " My Life " are by far the best works in this album .
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00000IAU3	5	Sure , she sounds alot like Sarah Mclachlan , but she has a style of her own . <sssss> She has a beautiful voice and i enjoy hearing the whole cd . <sssss> " Hunter " is a great song and is my favorite song that hasnt been released so far . <sssss> Thank You is a great song , which Eminem sampled . <sssss> This version of it is so much better . <sssss> This album is pretty mellow , but isnt bland , which is a rare feat for a new artist . <sssss> I 'd look for her to be doing what Macy Gray did last year-explode after grammy nods . <sssss> This cd deserves grammies . <sssss> Its awesome . <sssss> Only this album has gone platinum and bulleted up the charts . <sssss> Its beautiful Music . <sssss> Five Stars .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00000IAU3	5	It took around a year , to get this album out of the oblivion , why ? <sssss> , just because it takes radio to listen everything around in a rap song to began playing it , sadly that 's a big trend in the business , rap has taken over the top 40 , and it 's not letting go ... , No Angel showcased an artist that produced an amazing contemporary Adult top 40 album that feature a s style that has been almost vanished from radio waves , the ballad , and the sentimental songs , No Angel is a fution between great lyric ballad with slow downtempo electronica beats , every tracks gives the album the push it need it to become one of the best selling album of the new millenium , the highlights of this album are definitely " Here With Me " a trong ballad the portrait the unconditional love , and the need of it , " Hunter " speak about the freedom an space in every relationship , " All You Want " a personal favorite , and one of the most deeply sounding of the album , great chorus line , " Thanyou " the hit , overall this album includes many songs that are well constructed and not even get close to be fillers or flops , this album really stand out of the crowd , and should become an all time classic .
A33R34S1ZYG9XE	B00000IAU3	5	I like this album , although have really yet to listen to it . <sssss> I took some of the other reviews to heart while reviewing this album . <sssss> The song " All You Want " is a good song , along with " Here With Me " and especially " Thank You " ( great song ) , ( Better when it 's not in Eminem 's song Stan ) , this album refuses to die , after 45 weeks at # 4 , and the single " Thank You " currently at # 6 , and a good video to go with the song . <sssss> Finally we are being introduced to a new female artist with a great an gentle voice , how she was ignored by the Grammy 's is a big mystery . <sssss> I compare her to Sarah Mclachlan for a couple reasons , her voice and songwriting , both women are great at both , and both have to ability to rip your heart out with their painful but haunting voices . <sssss> I think I will continue to like Dido even more as she keep releasing songs from this album , by the way why did n't she sing with Eminem at the Grammys , but keep bringing out quality music , because you have a new fan , just no more duets with Eminem .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B00000IAU3	4	... . <sssss> though she ai n't evvybody 's litre of ale , I found Dido 's CD to be refeshingly enjoyable . <sssss> The mix of acoustics and smooth electronica backdropped to Dido 's seamless vocals is perfect . <sssss> I ai n't gon na say who she sounds like -- you make the comparisons . <sssss> I got this as a gift from my friends based on the strength of the jam " Thank You " . <sssss> Like so many things I took a while to get into the CD . <sssss> I 'm glad I did . <sssss> My favorite cut -- " Honestly OK " : it has enough of those blips and synthet raindrops and other sound exotica to take your ears on a sonic cruise ....
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00000JWQH	4	There is definitely not ONE song on this album that I do n't like . <sssss> Seriously . <sssss> It 's that good . <sssss> I think Mary 's album , My Life is SO overrated . <sssss> I know this because I bought it for my aunt years back , and decided to borrow it sometime earlier this year or last , and besides the singles , it was definitely lacking . <sssss> Most of the songs were boring and some of them even sounded the same . <sssss> This album is much different . <sssss> It is n't Mary the " Queen of Hip Hop soul " , it 's Mary at a vulnerable point ; the R&B ; songstress . <sssss> It brings great joy to know that she co-wrote most of the material . <sssss> I just love when people do that , you can relate more . <sssss> All of the songs are at least decent but my favorites are : All That I Can SayDeep InsideBeautiful OnesI 'm In LoveTimeMemoriesThe last track Let No Man Put Asunder is a big change from the whole CD . <sssss> It 's not like any other track that Mary has done but strangely , it fits . <sssss> I HIGHLY recommend this CD if you are a fan of R&B . <sssss> ; Music at its finest . <sssss> Cover Art : A-Songwriting : A-Vocals : BProduction : ALength : A+O verall : A4 .5 stars.P.S . <sssss> And just for a heads up do n't bother with Mary 's Love and Life either cause it has 2 or 3 hot songs & that 's about it.P.S.S . <sssss> This CD only had two singles , right ? <sssss> All That I Can Say and Deep Inside ... What a shame though because Mary truly shines on this album . <sssss> I 'm In Love is my jam !
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00000JWQH	4	I would n't call this Mary J. Blige 's best album ( everyone knows My Life gets that honor ) , but it was pretty darn close . <sssss> On this album you 'll find Mary growing in her music : vocally , conceptually , and musically . <sssss> Mary yearns for acceptance in " Deep Inside " , which cleverly samples Elton John 's " Bennie And The Jets " . <sssss> From there she brings simple-yet-dope music ( " I 'm In Love " ) and soothing ballads ( " No Happy Holidays " , " Give Me You " , " The Love I Never Had " ) . <sssss> There are n't really any uptempo tracks to be found on here except for the last track , " Let No Man Put Asunder " . <sssss> At first that song sounds like it might be out of place , but what makes it a winner is Mary and her backup singers ' gospel-like voices and melody ; also , it does n't sound like a party joint . <sssss> If you 're thinking of skipping a few songs on this album , I can understand . <sssss> " Sexy " sounds like someone else is singing instead of Mary , and I do n't know anyone who did n't fall asleep while listening to " All That I Can Say " . <sssss> Another thing I 'll say is that this album is only for true MJB fans only . <sssss> This is because her singing voice produces an alto throughout this entire album ( and she does n't hit any high notes ) , and this was the first time she did so , so non-fans may think this album sounds a little strange . <sssss> But this is still a very good album . <sssss> So hurry up and pick up the last really decent CD Mary J. Blige made .
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B00000JWQH	4	Mary J. Blige 's fourth proper studio album easily remains one of her very best efforts . <sssss> It was not commercially very successful , but Mary 's fans well know this is not what matters most with her . <sssss> Instead , it captures the diva 's essence so profoundly as few other albums did . <sssss> Similarly to " My Life " , it did not need to send out many radio hits to be great . <sssss> However , the list of collaborators shows how respected the singer is -- Lauryn Hill , Elton John , Aretha Franklin , George Michael ( duet As " , penned by Stevie Wonder " was omitted from the US edition ) Eric Clapton , Babyface , Diane Warren , Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis ... need I say more ? <sssss> Listen to this . <sssss> Released in the last millennium ( 1999 ) , it remains as fresh as ever . <sssss> Deep , moving , groovy and old-school , this is r & b at its most radiant . <sssss> Highlights include " All That I Can Say " , " Beautiful Ones " , " As " , " Time " , " Memories " , " Do n't Waste Your Time " and more .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B00000JWQH	5	" Mary " is Mary J. Blige 's album that starts her career at a new direction . <sssss> Before the release , she was known as a hardcore street smart artist . <sssss> This album proves that she 's beginning to mellow . <sssss> Such musical quality answers why she 's reigned as The Queen of Hip-Hop . <sssss> She offers a deeper R&B feel with deeper lyrics that are written and performed further into the heart . <sssss> Whether she 's singing about loneliness , love , religion , or strength , she never flaws for one second . <sssss> She takes the listeners to a time of R&B that many miss . <sssss> R&B quality of this level has rarely been released within the last twenty years . <sssss> Her collaborations with Lauryn Hill , K-Ci , The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin , Elton John , and Eric Clapton add an extra enjoyable flavor to this album . <sssss> She starts the CD beautifully with the Lauryn Hill-produced track " All That I Can Say " , which explores ole-skoop R&B modern day hip-hop . <sssss> The theme introduced the listeners to what 's to come , especially the soulful theme . <sssss> Her ballads , the majority of the album , are some of the best in her career . <sssss> They prove that she continues to evolve wonderfully as an artist , and that her best is yet to come . <sssss> Her last album track " Let No Man Put Asunder " , a dance track , proves that she 'll be around for much longer . <sssss> This highly underrated album is the ultimate album for the ultimate Mary J. Blige fan . <sssss> This will please many listeners for a long time . <sssss> Long live The Queen of Hip-Hop !
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B00000JWQH	4	This new cd from mary took her to another level in a lot of ways . <sssss> Her image , music , and lyrics are a little more mellow but still have the street vibe to it like before . <sssss> From the cover you can see she was going for something different with this one . <sssss> She wanted to let you feel mary .... . <sssss> and nothing else . <sssss> At first I only liked a few songs , but now it 's only 2 songs that I do n't like on this cd . <sssss> The best songs here are All that I can say ( favorite song ) , Deep Inside ( another tight one ) , Your child , Memories , Time and Do n't waste your time . <sssss> Some people think that she fell off with this cd or did n't bring the hip-hop like before . <sssss> I think she just wanted to bring a more R+B vibe this time . <sssss> It was supppsoed to be a double cd set with one cd of R+B and another one with Hip-hop . <sssss> By the end of this year Volume II should be out and after that I think people will appreciate the first cd more . <sssss> I think this was a good step up for mary , and something different from everything else . <sssss> Songs like " Deep Inside " are some of the deepest stuff she ever dropped and let you see what she really was feeling . <sssss> If your a fan or even a non-fan I think you should check this out . <sssss> Mary !
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00000JWQH	5	MARY is quite possibly Mary J Blige 's crowning achievement . <sssss> Though nearly devoid of her usual spat of uptempo songs-here , but in short supply-she nonetheless delivers a stunning set of soul-searching songs . <sssss> The album pays tribute to the funk and R&B of the 70 's and early 80 's , where Stevie Wonder shined with such albums as SONGS FROM THE KEY OF LIFE . <sssss> Though each track stands as some of her strongest material to offer , there are a few classics I must point out . <sssss> " All That I Can Say " is a beautifully written , mid tempo song , where Mary injects enough emotion to clarify the beauty and bliss of love , making this one of the album 's best tracks . <sssss> " Sexy " and " Beautiful Ones " borrow hip hop beats , but not too heavy to take away from her voice in the song , that slides along smoothly . <sssss> Vocally , this is Mary at her best . <sssss> She also does a few covers here . <sssss> The Gap Band 's " I 'm In Love " , and a cover of the disco hit " Let No Man Put Asunder " , and she ads her own magic to these classic songs . <sssss> " Your Child " is a tragic song about a man who refuses to acknowledge his own child . <sssss> " Deep Inside " and " The Love I Never Had " are emotional outpouring 's of Mary , dealing with the media pressure , and falling in love with someone who does n't have the same feelings . <sssss> Overall this is Mary 's best album , each song offers something different for the listener . <sssss> The real injustice is radio refused to play this album , and I will conclude that MARY is one of the best albums from the 90 's , a true classic .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B00000JWQH	4	I actually listened to this after amazon recommnded that I listen to this album . <sssss> So i did and I thought it was pretty good . <sssss> She 's talented . <sssss> I mean there 's a reason that she has sold over 40 million albums . <sssss> I will say that it sounded like a generic gospel album such as Mary Mary or Kirk Franklin . <sssss> In that respect I will say that it was n't as good as some of her other work . <sssss> On best this album is average , she could have done better . <sssss> I actually thought the last few tracks such as I thought Your child and The Love I never had . <sssss> They were thought provoking and you really got to see how she really felt about growing up with have n't her parents around to much . <sssss> For that i give her some props . <sssss> Also there were some pretty slick beats , and most of the album relaxing to listen to . <sssss> If your looking for mary j 's best work look at her other albums . <sssss> If you have a love for gospel music ( modern day ) or adult r & b then this is for you !
A149OQJD0ASI07	B00000JWQH	4	Mary 's fourth album " Mary " was nothing like it 's predecessors ... and yet was in a way another groundbreaking album . <sssss> This is perhaps her most soulful LP in her entire catalog . <sssss> It lacked the raw hip hop energy of What 's the 411 & Share My World . <sssss> It 's another vibe album . <sssss> It 's beautiful , but I 'd be lying if I did n't say it 's not an album your average teeny bopper , Screw head , corner thug or around the way gurl can relate to. <sssss> I was in my senior year of college when this album dropped and it took time for me to appreciate how great it really was . <sssss> This was one of many signs that I was growing and maturing just like Mary and her style . <sssss> All That I Can Say , the lead off single , is representative of this album 's laid back feel . <sssss> She was definitely off of the My Life misery and onto a stronger , love-yourself ethos here . <sssss> She definitely makes a concerted effort to deal with mature , adult relationships that only those who 've truly " lived life " will feel -- i.e. <sssss> she jumps from singing of finding the love of her life to the scorn of finding out that love has cheated to singing from the perspective of " the other woman " . <sssss> Other great tracks include Your Child , No Happy Holidays , Beautiful Ones ( my personal favorite ) and Do n't Waste Your Time . <sssss> Her classic , classic track here is I 'm Not Lookin ' with ole dude from Jodeci . <sssss> The Love I Never Had is a close second ( Note : This is a track she later won a grammy for best live R&B ; vocal performance for in 2001 , I believe ) . <sssss> If you 're into old Stevie Wonder cuts , you 'll probably love this album more than any other offering from Mary . <sssss> This LP is not recommended for music consumers under 19 , but it 's probably the Mary album I 'd play first when moms & pop get 2 bragging about " back in the day " cats and how contemporary R&B ; has lost it 's soul . <sssss> Mary 's got ta resounding answer 4 dat !
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00000JWQH	5	In 1999 , I did n't think much of Mary J. Blige 's fourth studio album , " Mary " . <sssss> The mood and flavor were too mellow for my taste , although I did like the Lauryn Hill-penned " All That I Can Say " . <sssss> But having recently listened to it for the first time in 3 years , " Mary " is Blige at her most mature , relaxed , and confident . <sssss> Of course , drama in relationships is the theme of this album , but the Queen of Hip Hop Soul pulls it off without like sounding like a guest on the Jerry Springer show . <sssss> Blige ca n't seem to find a man who will love her for the right reasons on " Deep Inside " , which smartly borrows the piano bit from Elton John 's " Bernie and the Jets " . <sssss> The lyrics to the crushing " Your Child " tell a story of a man who ca n't bring himself to acknowledge or accept his newborn child . <sssss> The Babyface-produced " Do n't Waste Your Time " is an impressive duet that shows that Blige can hold her own beside Lady Soul herself , Aretha . <sssss> But the disc 's real showstopper is " Not Lookin ' " in which Blige and ex K-Ci enjoy a battle of the pipes to see who can outsing whom . <sssss> For all that 's good , you have to wonder why Blige would bother to sing a Diane Warren ballad , the sappy " Give Me You " , but , then again , one lackluster song out of 14 tracks ai n't bad at all . <sssss> " Mary " is a career-defining statement of maturity that proves that Blige is going to remain with us for a while .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00002MZ4W	3	Fiona Apple 's When the Pawn ... is an ok album of sorts . <sssss> Boy is she angry and pissed on these songs . <sssss> After that MTV fiasco in 1997 , Fiona became an outspoken and muchly hated woman for speaking her mind . <sssss> This album is very different from her debut album , Tidal . <sssss> Standout tracks include : Limp , Fast as you Can , Love Ridden , Paperbag , Get Gone , and The Way Things Are . <sssss> The rest of the songs I did n't care for , nothing drastically wrong with them just middle of the road tracks . <sssss> Some of the songs are too jazzy and slow for my taste . <sssss> But the songs I do like are strong and gutsy , especially the song Limp , " You feed the beast I have within me , you wave the red flag baby you make it run , run , run , standing on the sidelines waving and grining , you fondle my trigger then you blame my gun ... " The song Love Ridden would actually fit better on her Tidal album , haunting and gorgeous song though , " Love ridden I 've looked at you , with the focus I gave to my birthday candles , I 've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow and baby I wished for you ... " When the Pawn shines in certain places but otherwise average to my picky ears .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00002MZ4W	3	I do n't think that Fiona Apple 's sophmore release is bad , I just think that it pales in comparison to Tidal . <sssss> And while this is less than extradinary , it is , however , much better than some other similar disappiontments in recent years , such as Strange Little Girls by Tori Amos and Exciter by Depeche Mode . <sssss> The lyrics ( though not as good as Tidal 's ) are as witty as ever , but while the dark sarcasm is still evident it 's not as forward as on Tidal . <sssss> I also find the songs to have weaker melody lines that are thin on hooking the listener . <sssss> The piano parts are also less beautiful here with more chaotic chords that seem to go nowhere . <sssss> The only songs that really strike me as being good are " The Way Things Are " and her first single , " Fast As You Can " . <sssss> I just love how she sings really quick on the verses and then slows things down on the soothing bridge release only to pick things up again in a feverish tornado . <sssss> I even tried singing it once but found myself laughing too much because I did n't know the words very well ... ( LOL ! <sssss> ) . <sssss> I just hope that when and if she does bring another album out that it will be better than this less than stellar follow-up to a grammy-worthy debut.P.S . <sssss> - If you understand what the title means in full than please oblige me by letting me know !
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B00002MZ4W	5	Whereas Tidal was the product of an unhoned prodigy 's raw instinct , When the Pawn ... is a tempering of Fiona Apple 's lyrical and musical sense into a disciplined and thoroughly enjoyable whole . <sssss> Firstly , her singing : Now fully in command of her smoky , dark voice , Apple 's delivery is greatly improved , with a confidence never before exhibited . <sssss> It helps that her melodic sense has taken a quantum leap in the past three years ; there are no longer any more quaint , unsure moments like " Shadowboxer " on Tidal . <sssss> Producer Jon Brion ( Aimee Mann ) must also have contributed his infallible ear to the arrangements because When the Pawn ... offers a much richer , more distinct sound , and overall a more addictive one . <sssss> Apple 's piano sounds great , the fiery parts recalling Tori Amos ' ferocious work on her From the Choirgirl Hotel album or Laura Nyro in her '60s heyday , and even when the songs lapse into sections of jazz-blues jamming ( usually more fun for the players than the listener ) , on this record they merely serve to augment the spontaneity of the songs and the immediacy of the performances . <sssss> A work worthy of an artist on the rise , When the Pawn ... is a work that Fiona Apple should be very proud of . <sssss> She has succeeded in mining her best assets while leaving her past faults behind .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00002MZ4W	5	Truly speaking , Fiona Apple must be the female version of Beck . <sssss> Fusing all kinds of grooves and rhythm into her impeccable music on this album , listenin to When The Pawn is like continuing from where she left us off on Tidal . <sssss> Sounding more mature with less anguish , Fiona adds a jazz touch to her songs which covers both depth and artistry . <sssss> Whereas other similar age-group females are crooning teeny-bopper stuff , Fiona is truly and definitely more mature and endearing . <sssss> EXCELLENT tracks include To Your Love , Paper Bag , Mistake , Fast As You Can and The Way Things Are . <sssss> The twists and turns are especially unexpected in the 1st single FAST AS YOU CAN ! <sssss> You go girl !
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00002MZ4W	4	When Fiona Apple first came out with her debut album " Tidal " , I was n't sure what to make of her but over time her songs grew on me and I eventually bought the album . <sssss> I loved " Tidal " and still do to this very day . <sssss> Fiona is one of the few rare young artists who wears her emotions on her sleeves and does n't come off as a flash in a pan or as some sort of poseur ( see Avril Lavigne ) . <sssss> When Fiona released her second album " When the Pawn ... " , I could n't believe the ridiculousness of the length in her album title . <sssss> I thought it was the silliest thing I have ever seen , not to mention a bit on the pretentious side . <sssss> To be honest , I did n't think ( and I still do n't ) that the follow-up to " Tidal " was able to match up to its predecessor . <sssss> " Tidal " is definitely my favorite of the two Fiona Apple cds . <sssss> " When the Pawn ... " is n't terrible by all means but it I find myself liking " Tidal " slightly more . <sssss> Nevertheless there are still some solid songs on " When the Pawn ... " . <sssss> My favorites includes : " Fast As You Can " , " On the Bound " , and " Paper Bag " . <sssss> Fiona still manages to crank out songs that shows her angst in her lyrics with the sparse melodies of her piano playing with heavy bass beats in the background . <sssss> Jon Brion does a marvelous job as the producer . <sssss> Since her last boyfriend dumped Fiona a year or two ago , I can only imagine what her next album will sound like . <sssss> Hopefully Fiona 's third album will be released sometime in this lifetime .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00002MZ4W	4	Fiona Apples latest CD is a work of art in progress . <sssss> Though she is a wonderfully talented musician , her songs get stuck in the same conformity of music impression . <sssss> Although I love all her songs on here , I feel she should venture out in other avenues . <sssss> Do n't get me wrong this is a wonderful album , I would just like to here a little more diversity . <sssss> A recommendation of 4 stars to this compiliation . <sssss> I prefer " Tidal " over this work , but " Pawn " still shows this woman has a long career ahead of her .
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B00002MZ4W	4	The space cadet kook-fest she personified with the uneven " Tidal " is vanished and in her place comes this generations premiere poet / songwriter . <sssss> " When The Pawn ... " [ a condensed mantra that goes on for 90 words ] elaborates further Apple 's promise / disappointment of " Tidal " , a debut that too often pandered to cacophonous ramblings too mature for their own good . <sssss> She showed a fierce ability for intense melody and adult vocals , but too often fumbled in the face of all the confusion . <sssss> With " ... Pawn " , Apple allocates brilliantly , a middle ground for her vocal capability and intricate melody and phrasing . <sssss> Her songwriting would make [ early ] Joni Mitchell proud , evoking a poets pen more so than any of the newer , young singer / songwriters . <sssss> And if Sony Music has the balls to release her new ' Extraordinary Machine ' single , then you will all see exactly what i mean . <sssss> My grade : A
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B00002MZ4W	4	When the Pawn ... took several listens before I could really get into it . <sssss> At first I thought it was too weird but I gave it another chance and now I love it ! <sssss> My favorite song on the album is Limp , which has some cool drum beats . <sssss> I just wish there was at least one upbeat song on this album . <sssss> All of the ten tracks are gloomy and serious and it would be nice to have a happy song thrown into the mix . <sssss> Still , this album is excellent ! 
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00002MZ4W	5	2 years ago , I bought this album because of all the glowing reviews the critics put in . <sssss> And i listened to it occasionally , not really thinking of it significant ... <sssss> But then a couple weeks ago i was dusting off my old CD 's and came across this one and decided to give it a spin . <sssss> I was blown away from hearing those same piano chords from " on the bound " and the creeping intro to " limp " ... Fiona Apple is a great talent in music today , and will hopefully for a long time . <sssss> As i listened to this album more and more , there began to be more and more songs i absolutely adored - like " Get Gone " , with an awesome piano hook , bridge and chorus . <sssss> The album really shows off her maturity at such a suprisingly young age and shows all that she can do . <sssss> I can definately see why Entertainment Weekly named it the number 1 album of 1999 , and places like rolling stone and music-critic . <sssss> com giving it perfect reviews . <sssss> Its an album not to be questioned .
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B000035X1M	3	D'Angelo 's " Voodoo " is undeniably one of the most sexy and groovy recordings of the neo-soul era . <sssss> Scoring many successes , including Best R&B Album Grammy for 2000 , it almost fills disc capacity with some 78 minutes of music . <sssss> This makes the record a little too long , with even the groove somehow lacking power after " Feel Like Makin ' Love " , which is one of the very few tracks here with a trace of any melodic hook . <sssss> Otherwise , it 's a sensual , raw and throughly black affair , but ... and unsummarised . <sssss> Inspired tracks such as " Chicken Grease " with fabulous guitar work are too few ; some other occasional strikes of genius do occur , such as Roy Hargrove solo on " Spanish Joint " and D'Angelo voice on , let 's say , " The Line " and " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " . <sssss> However , most songs lack gradation and compelling inner structure ; the emphasis on the mood is so heavy that it ultimately can make { you } tired prematurely .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B000035X1M	5	The time of the release of " Voodoo " , it had been five years since his debut album " Brown Sugar " . <sssss> Suddenly , he released his sexy music video " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " . <sssss> This caught many audiences ' attention . <sssss> This is only part of his tremendous quality . <sssss> The album 's musical quality proves that the five years was worth the wait . <sssss> Behind the sexy image is a genius R&B ; musician . <sssss> This is one of the best R&B ; album releases in years . <sssss> In 2000 , D'Angelo deservingly won two Grammys : Best R&B ; Album and Best Male R&B ; Performance . <sssss> It returns the grooves and the soul that had n't been heard in years . <sssss> His unique catchy grooves captivates audiences the whole listen . <sssss> Though the 13-track album runs 79 minutes , he uses every second wisely . <sssss> There is never a single dull moment . <sssss> This accomplished difficult task offers the ultimate unforgettable R&B ; journey . <sssss> These toe-tapping beats combined with neo-soul grooves brings D'Angelo up to Marvin Gaye 's level . <sssss> The album 's realism deserves him great respect as a true artist . <sssss> He wrote and performed every song beautifully . <sssss> His own inner soul is wonderfully expressed through every track . <sssss> Whether he sings a ballad or an upbeat song , his voice blends perfectly with the music . <sssss> Those that feel that the lyrics are hard to understand must know that he intended the grooves to be more pronounced . <sssss> Few artists have accomplished this as well as he did . <sssss> He also performed his own instruments wonderfully , which brings listeners closer to his words and his themes . <sssss> " Voodoo " is a great album for the ultimate R&B ; or neo-soul fan . <sssss> This is destined to be a classic while continuing to captivate many listeners . <sssss> [ Note ] : For those looking to understand the lyrics better , turn up the stereo three or four notches more than usual . <sssss> It 'll help a lot .
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B000035X1M	4	Considered by many to be the best R&B ; AND neo-soul album of the year 2000 , D'Angelo scored big with his sophomore album Voodoo . <sssss> I do n't know if it was indeed the best of 2000 , but this album does contain the best ( if not self-indulgent ) work he 's ever done . <sssss> He released the neo-soul jump-off album Brown Sugar in 1995 and then took a Sade-esque hiatus for five years , and after Voodoo has been pushed back millions of times , it finally came out in 2000 . <sssss> Led by the Raphael Saadiq-assisted " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " , the strongest cut on the album , Voodoo is very short on flaws . <sssss> " Left & Right " featuring Redman and Method Man neither helps nor hurts the album , but there are bangers aplenty like the funky " Chicken Grease " , the Latin-influenced " Spanish Joint " , and the much-covered classic , " Feel Like Makin ' Love " . <sssss> This song has a jazzy feel to it that makes it different than the many ballad versions of this song . <sssss> And D'Angelo even does a " freestyle " on " The Line " as he just lets the slick bassline ride while he speaks his mind about haters in his way. <sssss> D ' Angelo has used this album to really show that he has improved his sound , vocals , and songwriting . <sssss> However , you might find yourself looking at your watch an awful lot . <sssss> Clocking at close to 80 minutes , most of the songs are one or two minutes too long . <sssss> This length also adds to the redundancy of the album : while every track holds its own individually , after a while everything starts to sound the same . <sssss> But the fact that people mention D'Angelo 's name when talking about great soul legends like Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway may show that the 5 " 6 " artist must have been doing something right .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B000035X1M	5	D'Angelo has a winner on his hands , with one of the best albums from 2000 , his sophmore album Voodoo . <sssss> The album is very eclectic and very textured in its sounds , and his calm soothing voice is strong and beautiful . <sssss> The album is very urban sounding , but one would classify this under Urban , Soul , R&B and hip hop as it lends itself to many music genres . <sssss> Key tracks include : Playa Playa , Send It On , Chiken Grease , Untitled and Africa . <sssss> You must get this album it is amazing and there is nothing like it out there .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B000035X1M	5	This new cd from D'angelo is tight . <sssss> It 's one of thsoe cds you can just let it play without skiping from track to track because every song flows into the next . <sssss> The title is a good title because he works voodoo on you with the smooth beats and lyrics on this cd . <sssss> The songs have a deep message but you wo n't get it at first listen . <sssss> If you read the lyrics in the booklet , you will probably be wondering if your listening to the same cd . <sssss> Once you listen a few times , you really see how good it is . <sssss> I have his first cd and I thought it was good . <sssss> This one I thought was aiight at first , . <sssss> but now I think it 's better than the first . <sssss> Best songs : 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9 , 12 and 13 . <sssss> I know thats about the whole cd but it 's that good . <sssss> This is TRUE SOUL for the ' oo like no other and if you do n't know about this already ? <sssss> , then you need to start by checking this out . <sssss> Don ' t take my word for it alone . <sssss> Listen and see that it 's not just voodoo thats making people buy it . <sssss> Tight !
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B000035X1M	2	With all this talk of critics calling D'Angelo a genius , I wasexpecting " Voodoo " to be one of the year 's best . <sssss> A blend of fearless funk and top-drawer lyrics . <sssss> And what did I get ? <sssss> Anoverlong , boring , and quawky sounding album . <sssss> D ' Angelo 's falsettois beginning to sound like a cat yawning , in other words ' he needs a new singing style . <sssss> Now I have to say that " Chicken Grease " and " The Root " may be good , but other than that " Voodoo " isbasically just one , long , redundant 78-minute track .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000035X1M	3	first of all i think D'angelo has talent . <sssss> but five years for this ? <sssss> the positives the music does n't sound like the junk that 's out here now and real instrumentation . <sssss> the songs that stood out are the root , Spanish Joint is the best cut , Untitled ( how does it feel ) is the best cut prince has n't done in years . <sssss> the stuff that does n't work left & right with method man & redmen that makes no sense . <sssss> most of the album sounds just like the last one . <sssss> you have to change your groove . <sssss> it has catchy riffs like on the song feel like making love the classic song by Roberta Flack with the horn part . <sssss> but it suffers from too much sameness aside from the tracks with Roy Hargrove & charlie Hunter who plays solid axe . <sssss> the track AFRICA from the start with that drum track is a bite of I wonder u by Prince & the revolution from the parade album under the cherry moon soundtrack . <sssss> he should just get into Prince 's band . <sssss> musically he is not on Prince 's level . <sssss> he should not take five years for much of the sameness . <sssss> his baby 's moma Angie Stone has a way better album than this check that out . <sssss> it 's one thing to be influenced by someone it 's another to be stuck in there mirror . <sssss> D ' angelo , Maxwell , Lenny Kravitz are talented but not on Prince 's old level . <sssss> if you are on Prince 's tip and want to be cleaver listen to MESHALLNDEOCELLO . <sssss> shes the closes thing and yet maintains her own thing . <sssss> the next one by D should not take 5 years . <sssss> you have to be a superstar and not a clone .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000035X1M	3	D'Angelo 's hotly anticipated " Voodoo " was delayed for at least a year and a half before it was finally released to overall gleaming reviews . <sssss> But I think those reviews were praising D'Angelo 's talent instead of his actual album . <sssss> As impressive as some of the stuff is , " Voodoo " proves that great talents do n't always make great records . <sssss> Following the masterpiece that was his debut , " Brown Sugar " , I expected D'Angelo 's second album to be a step forward , and , in some respects , it is . <sssss> " Left and Right " , " Chicken Grease " , and " Spanish Joint " are a handful of the smokin ' cuts that serve up the Prince-inspired funk we 've come to expect . <sssss> But the album , as a whole , seems slightly unfocused , filled with grooves that take off well but run around in circles like a dog chasing its tail . <sssss> And at an obscenely long 79 minutes , it nearly wears out his welcome . <sssss> The final verdict ? <sssss> " Voodoo " is a mess . <sssss> But it 's a fascinating , intriguing mess that has its strokes of brilliance . <sssss> Those very strokes of brilliance make this album worth checking out , but it 's not quite the neo-soul masterpiece we were hoping for . <sssss> In my school of music , " Voodoo " gets a B - .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B000035X1M	5	The real star of this album is Ahmir ' ? <sssss> uestlove ' Thompson . <sssss> Listening to the brilliant grooves on this album , one can hardly imagine the sessions without his sharp , rimshot funk and solid head nodding , snare / highhat genius . <sssss> From the slow , off-center rhythm of " Playa Playa " , to the jazzy , Latin flavored " Spanish Joint " , his playing is a wonder to behold . <sssss> Rarely has a musician so fully understood the concept of playing to complement a piece of music , and from start to finish " Voodoo " is his show . <sssss> Any singer with a half decent voice can do what D'Angelo does , the now run - of - the - mill , profanity filled raps on " Left & Right " are nothing to get excited about , and the artwork is downright cheap ( a black & white photo of a shirtless D'Angelo looking like he 'd rather be someplace else ? <sssss> ... <sssss> Please ! <sssss> ) , but the solid drumming of Brother ? <sssss> uestlove is the real reason to own this pretty solid sophomore album . <sssss> Just listen to the way he whomps his snare on the FUNKY remake of " Feel Like Makin ' Love " , or the gentle crash cymbal rolls that accent the otherwise lifeless " Send It On " , throughout , Thompson proves that less is more and what real music lovers want is a solid , consistent beat . <sssss> If we wanted flashy pyrotechniques , we can always listen to some Coltrane and let Elvin Jones do the trick , but for laid back , funky-as-hell , stomping and distinctive sounds , check out " Voodoo " . <sssss> Best cuts ; " Playa Playa " , " Left & Right " , " The Line " , " Chicken Grease " , " One Mo ' Gin " , and all of Side 2 . <sssss> This is the future of the funk . <sssss> Go Get A Late Pass , Step !
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B000035X1M	3	... . <sssss> like someone below mentioned , it could have benefited from a bit of editing ( shortening ) and an altering of some of the rhythm ... ok , to me that snare drum " clack-clock " beat in most of them cuts sometimes gets monotonous . <sssss> Hargrove horns help a lot . <sssss> It 's R and B , that 's fer sure , but I listen to a lot of Al Green , Sly , Marvin Gaye , and Tafkaf , all of which one way or another D' has been compared to ... and although D'angelo can manage a good sounding falsetto , and a Prince-like slow jam or so , this CD is no masterpiece on the level those artists spoken of above have made and could make ... there 's a great difference between musical pioneers / true innovators and someone out to overcome the " sophomore CD jinx " ( Ouch , Sorry ' bout that one ) . <sssss> " Voodoo " , indeed , has been greatly anticipated , yes , and fans of the current hip-hop influenced new soul scene will defend this new product to the hilt but ... but . <sssss> let 's say this has n't gotten my vote for the CD of the year . <sssss> It dose n't give me the feeling that it is truly revolutionary the way " Brown Sugar " was when it came out . <sssss> Let me continue bein ' real -- It IS cool , though . <sssss> It 's kinda like hip-hop lounge music . <sssss> It will probably go platinum . <sssss> I digs the track " Africa " and the remake of " Feel Like Making Love " . <sssss> Get it if you want a change of pace from the regular fare they play on radio , 'cause , although I 'm not one of the customer reviewers calling it a masterpiece , " Voodoo " is much , much , much better than what 's generally being offered in today 's R and B , and hip-hop radio market . <sssss> And that , my friends , is how I see it .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B00004R7SN	1	Was this album a dissapointment !! <sssss> I love Toni Braxton 's voice and I especially liked her first album and the second one ( although not as much as the first one ) but this one is a bore . <sssss> The only good songs are : He was n't man enough for me , Spanish Guitar and Never One for a Ring . <sssss> The rest is just plain terrible . <sssss> I hope her next offering is better . <sssss> Do n't waste your money on this one . <sssss> With that voice , she can do a lot better .

A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00004R7SN	2	Toni Braxton has always had one of the more distinctively fine voices in pop / R & B circles -- it 's always been a matter of finding just the right material for her to wrap it around . <sssss> Unfortunately , the majority of the songs found on THE HEAT do not fit into the category of " the right material " . <sssss> Though a master balladeer , Braxton came loaded to bear with no doubt the worst batch of slow jams she 's foisted on us yet . <sssss> It 's totally unfortunate that she scored so big with the now unlistenable ' Un-Break My Heart ' from her last album because she 's called on uber-hack Diane Warren not only for an even more inferior retread of that song ( ' Spanish Guitar ' ) , but also included another Warren weepie , ' I 'm Still Breathing ' , that makes one wish they were n't after hearing the typically insipid lyrics . <sssss> The rest of the ballads fall along those same lines , with the only standout being ' Just Be A Man About It ' . <sssss> Conversely , the uptempo fare here is like an oasis in a creatively dry desert -- ' He Was n't Man Enough ' and ' Gim me Some ' show that Braxton can at least hold her own with the likes of Rodney Jerkins and sound completely within her element doing so . <sssss> But three great tracks do hardly a good album make -- this is simply a subpar effort from someone capable of far more .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00004R7SN	3	After a 4-yr hiatus , Toni Braxton comes back with an even sexier image than her last which is n't really too bad . <sssss> But a far cry from 93 when she , with the short crop and in-ya-face attitude , came on the scene . <sssss> Toni , on her 1st album , was cool and seemed determine to set herself apart from fellow generic R&B stars . <sssss> But then came 96 's Secrets which contained that lung-soaring chartbuster hit by Daine Warren " UnBreak My Heart " broke her into super super-stardom but she lost her cool as well . <sssss> You 're Making Me High was the only excitment . <sssss> Same for here , the 1st relaese by teen super-writer Rodney Jenkins , " He 's Not Man Enuff " leads the album off to a bang but the rest of it , well , doesnt quite measure up . <sssss> Boring songs like Spanish Guitar , by Diane Warren and several others do not sound anything radically different from many other R&B albums out there but at least a consolation is Toni 's throaty and sometimes rapsy vocals !
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B00004R7SN	2	Luckily , I did n't buy this album , I was forced to hear it while my guy was playing it in his car . <sssss> In my opinion , Toni Braxton has n't been dope since her very first album . <sssss> After that point , she started to slowly fall into a Celine Dion-esque rut of having a great voice but wasting it on sappy C-level written ballads . <sssss> This album , The Heat , was the dumps . <sssss> Most of this album contains jams that you 'll listen to one day but will forget about in a year or two ( do you know anyone still playing " He Was n't Man Enough " ) ? <sssss> Also , the songwriting is less than stellar . <sssss> In one hand she wants to be played like a " Spanish Guitar " , whatever that means . <sssss> Then she tries to redeems herself with the provocative title track , but falls when she ends the song asking , " Anyone want some ice cream " ? <sssss> Toni 's lyrics has always been a little corny ( remember " Un-break My Heart " from Secrets ) , but on this album she 's at her worst . <sssss> But with most bad albums , there 's always two songs that save the day . <sssss> This time , those songs are " Just Be a Man About It " ( featuring Dr. Dre , but he 's only speaking , so that should n't count as a guest appearance , but a good marketing scheme , though ) and " You 've Been Wrong " . <sssss> But if you bought this album thinking it was her best work , you 've been wrong . <sssss> For vintage Toni Braxton , get her first album and maybe even Secrets , because this album needs to be re-Heated .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B00004R7SN	4	Admittedly I bought this album on auto-pilot years ago and never listened to it in entirety until recently which is a shame because it 's excellent . <sssss> I found some of the comments in reviews curious especially those who expressed concern that Toni was staying in the ballad lane and not really straying too far from those types of songs . <sssss> I 'm divided about this issue with certain singers because primarily I have an ' if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' mentality towards singers who simply perform better in certain genres of music . <sssss> I think that overall , Toni 's hit ballads and mid-tempo singles are all so distinct that they set her apart from other vocalist both within her era and those who 've come after her . <sssss> My favorite tracks are : HE WAS N'T MAN ENOUGH - great lead-off single , one of those songs that I never want to end while I 'm listening to itGIMME SOME - catchy , upbeat track with a guest rap by the late Left-EyeTHE HEAT - melodic trackFAIRY TALE - Toni 's voice sounds gorgeous on this beautiful trackSPEAKING IN TONGUES - great display of her vocalsJUST BE A MAN ABOUT IT - love the fact that Dr. Dre does not rap on the track but speaks conversationallySPANISH GUITAR - had to grow on my but this is a really pretty balladNEVER JUST FOR A RINGOne song of note is MAYBE - I really did n't like her singing style on this one , it reminds me of Beyonce 's quick singing style on early Destiny 's Child tracks and does n't suit Toni at allAgain this album is really well-produced , with great song placement - there are not back-to-back ballads or slower tempo songs which could lull a listener into boredom . <sssss> After listening to all of her albums recently , this is one where she really seems to have hit her stride and seems comfortable singing both uptempo and ballad types of songs .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00004R7SN	5	Toni Braxton is back with her hot new album The Heat . <sssss> 12 sizzling tracks . <sssss> Toni has one of the most amazing voices in the industry , she can sing very very low and sounds sexy . <sssss> He Wasnt Man Enough flew to the top of the charts at its release , but its not the only winner on the cd . <sssss> I think Fairy Tale should be a single , it is a beautiful song . <sssss> Spanish Guitar and Just Be A Man about it are great as well . <sssss> The title track is another great song that should also be a single . <sssss> Other mentionable songs : Gim me Some , Im Still Breathing , Maybe , Never Just For A Ring . <sssss> Go out and get it !
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00004R7SN	2	Toni Braxtons latest effort " The Heat " is her weakest album to date . <sssss> The only standout song is the first single " He Was n't Man Enough " which I think is still a weak song to say the least , from earlier efforts . <sssss> The rest of the songs are just a mish mash of R & B " I have heard this before " ballads , and mid-tempo songs that have no standout potential . <sssss> Always Braxton is in fine vocal form , but whatever she does she ca n't turn this piece of coal into a diamond . <sssss> Unfortunately I think because she lent a writing hand to 75 % of this CD , and in my own opinion I do n't think Braxton is a songwriter . <sssss> She should do like Janet Jackson does and have Terry Lewis & Jimmy Jam do their job , and if the artist has some input then fine . <sssss> Braxton is a singer , and what a beautiful voice she has , but she is not a songwriter which drops this album to just a average run of the mill piece of dribble . <sssss> A disappointment .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B00004R7SN	4	This is a really good Toni Braxton album . <sssss> " He Was n't Man Enough " is one of the best songs she 's recorded . <sssss> Rodney Jerkins produced it ( back when he was still hot and made some good music ) and it was an instant hit . <sssss> The rest of the album seemed to fall between the cracks , but THE HEAT is a good CD from Toni . <sssss> There 's lots of good ballads here like " I 'm Still Breathing " , " Fairytale " and " Speaking In Tongues " . <sssss> There 's some nice uptempo stuff like " Gim me Some " , " Maybe " , etc . <sssss> My favorites include " I 'm Still Breathing " , " Never Just For A Ring " , " Fairytale " , " Spanish Guitar " and " He Was n't Man Enough " . <sssss> A pretty solid effort from Toni Braxton .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B00004R7SN	5	After the big success of her first album " Toni Brxton " which became 8 times multi-platinum in the US and opened Toni all the markets around the world came " Secrets " which also was a big impact around the world with the # 1 's hits " you 're making me high " and " un-break my heart " , the album sold 12 million copies worldwide . <sssss> After this success and taking home 5 Grammy awards , Toni had a very bad time in her life after having a fight with her record company because they were n't paying what she deserved . <sssss> She came back in 2000 once again with Laface ( her record company ) with this magnificent album that debuted in the Billboard 200 at # 2 , the first single " he was n't man enough " became an instant hit and brought Toni her Grammy # 6 . <sssss> When I first bought " The heat " I found Toni 's change but in a fresher way with songs like " he was n't man enough " . <sssss> With " The heat " Toni opened a new style in her music , some of the songs have much more beat than her first ones , actually it 's a great combination between rhythm and blues , pop and hip-hop ... if you buy it I think you 're gon na love as I do .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B00004R7SN	4	Toni 's third album is a rich one full of good songs and for the first time she mixed both trademarks ballads and uptempo songs , more stright forward sexy then previous album " Secrets " but goes one step forward and explored other styles . <sssss> " The Heat " is both self secure and sensual . <sssss> A great list of songwriters also contributed to the track list here . <sssss> Jerkins produced " He Was n't Man Enough " was the big hit here , a catchy uptempo song about the a bad man . <sssss> That song had something we could n't expect from her some years before . <sssss> " Heat " is a sexy midtempo soul number while Diane Warren penned " Spanish Guitar " is a good ballad . <sssss> " Gim me some " is a catchy uptempo song co-written by Babycace that also wrote the song " Fairy Tale " that is more chilled down . <sssss> Austin 's " Just be Man about it " which also was single released follows the trend of quality soul here . <sssss> While the heat may not exactly be groundbreaking it 's defenitely a good soul album that mixes alot of diffrent kind of songs into one great concept . <sssss> Highly recommended . <sssss> Soon a new album out called " Libra "
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B00004R7SN	4	At first I was somewhat critical of this release ! <sssss> It does n't have a single Babyface-penned cut which has been a staple in the career of Miss Braxton . <sssss> It starts off with the current single " He Was n't Man Enough " , a tune that is radio-friendly with its foot-stomping bass line and too simple repeated chorus . <sssss> But this one aside , the other cuts are quite good . <sssss> The title cut is an effective ditty that complements the first . <sssss> " Spanish Guitar " is reminiscent of Braxton 's earlier " Un-break My Heart " while " I 'm Still Breathing " is classic Toni . <sssss> " Gim me Me " is a not-too-subtle suggestion for erotic encounters to come . <sssss> With her cover photo , it is obvious what she wants . <sssss> " Fairy Tale " , with its guitar accompaniment reminds one of smoke-filled night clubs and the best work of chantueses of the past . <sssss> Another cut " Maybe " allows Toni to do her patented form of " scatting " showing the range of her distinctive alto and phrasing that could be comparable to Ella Fitzgerald if that legend were a contemporary artist . <sssss> The violin accompaniment adds immensely to the effect of this one . <sssss> Although not as totally satisfying as her first two , number three is still most enjoyable and improves at each listening .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B00004R7SN	5	The first single " He Was n't Man Enough " makes me want to dance . <sssss> I could listen to it over and over . <sssss> It has a contagious beat to it . <sssss> The title cut The Heat is also a future dance track hit . <sssss> Diane Warren has written another great song . <sssss> " Spanish Guitar " is a sexy romantic ballad that reminds me of " Unbreak my Heart " . <sssss> The song " Speaking in Tougues " is about the power of non verbal communication between lovers . <sssss> It is a smooth jam that I find very enjoyable . <sssss> The song " Just Be a Man About it " is a lesson for the guys about how to break up with someone . <sssss> This song has honest direct lyrics any person can relate to . <sssss> This is a good CD that I highly recommend to R and B fans .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00004R7SN	5	A woman in Toni Braxton 's shoes could have been washed up by now . <sssss> Following the success of " Secrets " , Braxton 's career was dealt a near-fatal blow when she declared bankruptcy . <sssss> Her recording contract was hanging in the balance , and nobody was sure if she would ever return to the spotlight . <sssss> Braxton stayed strong , and after 4 years since her last album , she released " The Heat " , her third and best outing . <sssss> For the most part , the lyrics deal with the usual tribulations in relationships , but with none of the juvenile , talk-show nonsense you 'd find in other modern r & b records . <sssss> Toni Braxton is in her thirties , and she smartly picks material that reflects her age . <sssss> She teams up with Rodney Jerkins for the disc 's opener , " He Was n't Man Enough " a catchy slice of hip r & b. Dr. Dre makes a guest appearance in " Be a Man About It " , which features the rapper as a philanderer who just ca n't bring himself to tell Ms. Braxton that he wants out of the relationship . <sssss> The title track and the aptly-named " I 'm Still Breathing " are also noteworthy . <sssss> However , the disc 's sole dubious moment is " Spanish Guitar " , ... <sssss> Following the somewhat disappointing " Secrets " , Toni bounced back in a big way with this impressive record . <sssss> If you ca n't stand this " Heat " , then please leave the kitchen .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B00004R7SN	4	I was reluctant to bring this out of the vaults , because I remember how everybody said this album was terrible . <sssss> I guess I took their opinion as mine and just forgot about this album . <sssss> But when I finally started listening , I was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> No , this is not another Secrets or even her debut album , but it is still very good . <sssss> She manages to keep her old style while still incorporating new ideas . <sssss> There are a few minor missteps , and " The Art of Love " should have just been left off completely , but the rest is quality . <sssss> It makes me sad that she went from this to More Than A Woman ...
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00004R7SN	4	While it firmly re-established her presence on the charts after a long absence , " The Heat " too often sounds like mere product . <sssss> The title track is the best song here with it 's tight rhythm arrangement , sharp percussion and staccato vocals ( both lead and background ) all courtesy of production and keyboard whiz Keri Lewis of Mint Condition . <sssss> The rest of the LP treads familiar ground , but the overall effect is pleasing ear-candy for the masses . <sssss> A little too much filler for my taste , but the brilliant title cut makes this one just above average . <sssss> A welcome return .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00004UARR	5	I had heard of Jill Scott a long time ago , but never bothered buying her cd . <sssss> I thought " Great , another R&B girl " ! <sssss> Well , I regret that now ! <sssss> Jill 's music is unlike any music , not just R&B , I have ever heard . <sssss> I 'm almost tempted to call it alternative R&B ? <sssss> Her deep , and totally real , lyrics speak of everyday life and her rhythms are cool , unique , and very relaxing . <sssss> Jill 's music resembles that of no one else . <sssss> Her style of R&B is in a field of its own . <sssss> Alicia Keys , as it turns out , is not the most unique R&B crooner around ! <sssss> If you love to listen to music with 100 % heart and soul , no studio enhanced effects , and a voice that is as pure as gold , pick up a copy of Jill Scott 's debut album .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B00004UARR	5	The first time I listen to this CD , my jaw dropped ! <sssss> I could n't believe how wonderful it is . <sssss> Her lyrics have their own poetic and expressive style , which most other artists need . <sssss> She also makes some great political statements that she continues to sing as soulfully as the other tracks . <sssss> " A Long Walk " is one of the best R&B songs to listen to on a first date or on a regular walk around the park with that special someone . <sssss> " Getting In My Way " expresses her fierce side . <sssss> If you listen to this CD , I 'll guarantee that you 'll feel strong , independent , and moved .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00004UARR	5	Like Angie Stone , Jill Scott is greatly understated but still slightly more exposure than Stone . <sssss> She aint no looker but she exudes lotsa charm and attitude that most mediore so-called R&B divas can hardly match . <sssss> The first song Gettin ' In The Way is laden with attitude and sass plus a great female-enpowerment video to boot . <sssss> Tracks like Brotha & Love Rain fully explemplifies the soulfulness in Jill Scott . <sssss> She named the album Words And Sounds so that people would focus on the words in the lyrics and the sounds in her songs , and of cos that voice of hers ... and pay attention to all these for the CD is definitely one of the best of 2000 , despite not reaching the masses ...
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B00004UARR	5	I agree with previous posters that it 's hard to expound further on this cd when others have so eloquently written their reviews of it but I love the artist and the cd so much that I 'm going to add my two cents ... <sssss> This is a disc that still gets constant play in my house , in the car & at work ! <sssss> There was such a huge buzz on Jill Scott prior to the release of her debut that I could not wait to get my hands on it . <sssss> Every song & interlude just flows so magically into the track making this not only one of the best debuts by any artist but also one of the best " neo-soul " albums ever produced so those who still do n't know who Jill Scott is but enjoy good music will not be sorry in adding this disc to their collection . <sssss> My fave tracks to this day are : THE WAY , I THINK IT 'S BETTER , WATCHING ME , ONE IS THE MAGIC # , HE LOVES ME , IT 'S LOVE & HONEY MOLASSES . <sssss> Another honorable mention goes to LOVE RAIN ( although I like this version very much , I adore how she switched it up on her live cd ) .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B00004UARR	5	This is simply one of the most amazing albums of any kind of music ever made , and that is something that is definitely not easy to say , because so far , the 2000s have been THE decade of bad music as we know it . <sssss> The spare , haunting atmospheres on songs like " A Long Walk " , " Honey Molasses " , and " Slowly Surely " make it seem like you 're walking through the city on a misty , eerily quiet night , and the minimal ( but unfortunately not nonexistent ) use of samples makes it easier to appreciate Jill Scott 's talents as a musician .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00004UARR	5	Jill Scott has arrived ! <sssss> This CD is amazing from one song to the next , with her sultry , energetic expression of vocals to her simple yet poetic lyrics this CD is top rate . <sssss> All the cuts from this CD are absolutely fabulous , one of the best CDs in the last 10 years . <sssss> Jill Scott has a future , and it is so nice to see an artist who does n't have to get body augmentation ( Britney ) , or have to look like a futuristic teen hooker in " Irresistible " ( Jessica ) or grow their hair to Rapunzel hair length to sell records . <sssss> Jill sells on her vocals , her talent , her effervescent smile and beauty inside and outside , showing that she is a true music artist who enjoys and sings the music SHE WANTS . <sssss> So refreshing to have a female artist who is original these days . <sssss> Double platinum and counting ... . <sssss> you go girl ! <sssss> In 10 years Jill Scott will still be at the top of the charts while Britney and Jessica fight over what shifts to work at the One Hour Martinizing .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B00004UARR	4	This new one form Jill Scott is on some blazing neo-soul , jazzy , modern type music . <sssss> I heard this actually a month early from listening to power 99 fm in Philly ( local radio station ) . <sssss> The song they really started playing now is " Gettin in the way " and it takes the whole " get away from my woman / man " songs we hear all the time in a different direction creatively . <sssss> It reminds me of " On and On " from eryka badu but the base line and jazzy feel to it is tight and after the first listen you will probably be hooked on this . <sssss> The line that was kinda funny is when she was singing to the girl saying " You about to make me loose it and pull out my vasaline " ... . <sssss> meaning shes getting ready to rumble . <sssss> Other good tracks are " Dreaming " from the In too Deep soundtrack , One is the magic number , Brotha , and jiltro . <sssss> I should really say that these are the songs I like the most because the whole cd is tight . <sssss> Th eonly thing I have against it is that some of the tracks sound alike but overall she came strong . <sssss> A few of the tracks are spoken word so if anyone is deep into peotry they might want to check this one out . <sssss> Creatively she made a strong debut that is in the same ring with Eryka , Angie stone , D'angelo , maxwell etc . <sssss> New soul for 2000 ..... . <sssss> get it !
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00004UARR	5	Jill Scott first turned a multitude of heads by penning the brilliant hip-hop love jam " You Got Me " , which with the aid of Erykah Badu became a huge hit for fellow Philly-ites The Roots . <sssss> On The Roots ' subsequent live album COME ALIVE , Scott 's onstage performance swiftly dispelled any notion that her vocation as a songwriter was due to a lack of vocal skills . <sssss> Scott is easily Ms. Badu 's equal in sultry sensuality and subtle vocal acrobatics , and her lush , luxurious lyrics are almost on par with the patriarch of sexy lyrics himself , Prince . <sssss> WHO IS JILL SCOTT ? <sssss> reveals a first glimpse of her talent ; " Do You Remember " lives and breathes as practically a street-style homage to the Purple One . <sssss> While there is a slow , physical groove flowing through this debut , particularly captivating on tracks such as " Slowly , Surely " and " Honey Molasses " , Ms. Scott also shows herself capable of a certain force , evident on " One Is the Magic # " and " It 's Love " . <sssss> Her most alluringly raw moment comes on the hidden track " Love Rain " , a partial spoken word duet with Mos Def .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00004UARR	1	Nowadays if you have alittle Groove with a Touch of Jazz you have Talent ? <sssss> I still Stick To Sade . <sssss> But Jill Scott ai n't even Anita Baker . <sssss> this is 2nd tier Mary J. Bliege , Erika Badu Letovers . <sssss> how many tracks have that click clack sound that the Roots Questlove & D'Angelo use ? <sssss> I heard her on The Roots & on The WIld , WIld West Soundtrack & she was just Like Faith Evans a Mary J. Bliege Clone . <sssss> this is Why R-N-B is in The Toliet Now , No Challenges . <sssss> Jill Scott Needs To WOrking WIth PRINCE or SOmebody that has Real Talent instead of the same old Tip / Tap . <sssss> She is a Good Writter . <sssss> but the Music is Boring & Predictable . <sssss> this is n't the Philly Era of Gamble & Huff . <sssss> when Philly use to Rock . <sssss> Jill Scott is Closer To Deborah Cox or TOni Braxton ( Boring Predictable Music ) than Sade .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B00004UARR	5	Who Is Jill Scott ? <sssss> Words & Sounds , Volume 1 is the debut album from Jill Scott . <sssss> A Philadelphia native with an earthy voice , Ms. Scott can wrap herself around a sound . <sssss> She got her start by co-writing The Roots ' brilliant " You Got Me " on which the band collaborated with Erykah Badu . <sssss> Ms. Scott has drawn comparisons to Ms. Badu , but where Ms. Badu is icy smooth , Ms. Scott has much more power and grit to her voice . <sssss> " Gettin ' In The Way " is a brilliant piece of music with a sexy and sultry vocal while " A Long Walk " is lush & romantic . <sssss> " Honey Molasses " is as the title suggests , sweet & slow . <sssss> Ms. Scott expertly mixes the jazzy styling of the old school with the hip hop influences of today . <sssss> Who Is Jill Scott ? <sssss> the album titles asks . <sssss> The answer is an immensely talented and expressive singer .
A149OQJD0ASI07	B00004UARR	4	I personally would recommend buying Jill Scott 's sophomore opus " Beautifully Human ( 2004 ) " FIRST . <sssss> But you ca n't go wrong starting with this album if it 's indeed your intro to Jill Scott . <sssss> Who is Jill Scott ? <sssss> An around the way girl from North Philly whose as strong , feminine , positive and real as any black female singing talent since Mary J. Blige . <sssss> Oh , and did I mention this girl can SANG ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? <sssss> ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? <sssss> " Gettin ' in the Way " , was the song that introduced her to the world ... this black women 's anthem to handling the " other woman " . <sssss> It 's sassy and jazzy at the same time . <sssss> Yet , " A Long Walk " -- her second single -- was the song that won me over . <sssss> You got ta remember that circa fall 2000/spring 2001 the neo soul movement was running strong in the United States with Erykah Badu dropping " Mama 's Gun " , D'Angelo back out with " Voodoo " plus debuts from India . <sssss> Arie , Angie Stone and Musiq Soulchild . <sssss> This album will make you remember that time more than anything , though I honestly believe Jill 's second album " Beautifully Human " is the better album because there 's EVEN MORE JILL -- more substance , more love of self and love of life . <sssss> If Mary J. Blige = modern day Aretha Franklin and Erykah Badu = modern day Billie Holiday , then Jill 's got ta be a modern day Ella Fitzgerald . <sssss> If you like any and all of these singers , you 're gon na love Jill Scott .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00004UARR	5	By this point , the question " who is Jill Scott " is no longer relevant . <sssss> We ALL know who she is , thanks to this smokin ' debut . <sssss> The album sizzles with soul , oozes with sensuality , and pulsates with bangin ' beats and jazzy vibes that defy the conventions of modern r & b . <sssss> The lyrics are positive , upbeat , and self-empowering , but if you so much as cross this sista with any drama , she will quickly put you in check . <sssss> The dynamite " The Way " puts a smile on my face every time I hear it , and " Gettin ' in the Way " is simply hilarious as it makes it clear that Jill Scott is not a woman to be played . <sssss> The steamy " Exclusively " and " One is the Magic # " stand out as well . <sssss> Hidden Beach uncovered a rare gem of an album that elevates Scott as one of the most promising artists of the new millennium . <sssss> In my school of music , it merits an A.
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B00004UARR	5	I had been sleeping on Jill Scott for a while . <sssss> I did n't buy this album until about a year and a half ago , and I was missing out . <sssss> This is a classic . <sssss> It 's practically flawless . <sssss> Jill vocals are beautiful , jazzy and strong . <sssss> Every song on here is wonderful . <sssss> The production is great . <sssss> Jill 's delivery is exceptional and her little breaks into poetry add a nice touch , like on " Exclusively " . <sssss> The lyrics are great . <sssss> I really do n't know what else to say ... At the end , there are two hidden tracks : " Try " and " Love Rain " ( Remix feat . <sssss> Mos Def . <sssss> ) Both are very nice additions . <sssss> Buy this album today .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00004UARR	1	I do n't know what CD you simple-minded people out there are listening to , but I ca n't believe the undeserved praise you are heaping on this woman ! <sssss> This album is just ( as the title says ) a bunch of random " Words and Sounds " thrown together with no regard for thematic unity , cohesiveness , originality or depth . <sssss> Granted , Ms. Scott may possess some talent ( though I ca n't imagine what it is ) but whatever gifts she was given are squandered on this pretentious mess . <sssss> I suppose if I lived in the Ghetto , sat around spouting pointless " poetry " and only wrote songs about ' me ' , ' my woman ' , ' I 'm fine ' , ' the rain ' , ' the way my woman loves me ' , ( and what exactly is " Honey Molasses " ? <sssss> are n't they pretty much the same thing ? <sssss> And what does that have to do with the content of the song ? <sssss> ) , I 'd enjoy this more . <sssss> The self congratulatory tone of the lyrics , as I 've mentioned before are a mess , touting spirituality one moment , then threatening to ' take you out in the street and whup your tail ' the next . <sssss> And for goodness sake , can we please cease with the terrible little cymbal taps and repetitive , mindless drum tracks on EVERY song and then calling it ' jazzy ' , it 's not ! <sssss> How about , oh I do n't know , SOME ORIGINALITY ! <sssss> If this is all it takes to become a million-selling , Grammy Nominated superstar , then I want Hidden Beach to give me a record deal now . <sssss> Wake up people , this is not real music , it 's mere product and you 're all being played for fools . <sssss> I guess the old saying holds true : Ignorance Is Bliss .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00004YKUI	5	I love artists who give you advice / food for thought ; you can NEVER have enough of those . <sssss> Erykah has always had decent lyrics and made R&B ; her baby . <sssss> With songs like On & On , Tyrone , Next Lifetime , No Love , Sometimes and Drama how could you not respect this singer / songwriter ? <sssss> She 's a pretty solid artist in my opinion . <sssss> The standouts on Mama 's Gun are : Penitentiary Philosophy , ... & On , Booty , Orange Moon , In Love With You , Time 's A Wastin ' and Green Eyes . <sssss> Check this out ! <sssss> Fans of soulful R&B ; and food for thought are all welcome ! <sssss> Does n't matter your race or age just enjoy it ! <sssss> 4.6 stars . <sssss> -- Adrian
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B00004YKUI	5	Erykah definitely caught everyone 's attention with her debut album but a lot of people fell off the bandwagon when she released this disc . <sssss> I heard growth & beauty in this disc and hope that those who listened once and truly did n't " get " it , listen to it again when their musical tastes mature because this is one of the most beautifully put together soul / r & b ; albums I 'd heard in a long time . <sssss> My favorite tracks : PENETENTIARY PHILOSOPHY - funky & soulful ; DID N'T CHA KNOW - melodic with a great chorus ; HEY SUGAH - nice interlude , 70 's groove ; CLEVA - love the music production of this one ; KISS ME ON MY NECK ; ORANGE MOON - beautiful love song ; GREEN EYES - this is an exceptional track , it starts off like a really old jazz song with the scratchy backgroung then got really jazzy & soulful ; it almost sounds like 3 songs in 1 . <sssss> I would highly recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys good music - it 's an excellent representation of an artist growing right before our eyes ! 
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B00004YKUI	4	This new one from badu is a good follow up to baduizm . <sssss> I heard her first one and thought it was real good but never got around to buying it . <sssss> After hearing bag lady I didnt want to miss out on this one . <sssss> Was it worth the wait ?? <sssss> It was worth every penny and more . <sssss> Eryka took it to another level with this one . <sssss> At first it might not catch you because it 's not like the radio track bag lady . <sssss> Even the version thats on the album is different but after a few listens you really see how tight this cd is . <sssss> Every track flows into each other so there isnt any breaks of silence in between tracks . <sssss> The album plays like a story and each song has something different to say . <sssss> best tracks to me are : Did n't Cha know , My Life , & On , Cleva , Kiss me on my neck , orange moon , and in love with you . <sssss> On this album I really see why people compare her to bily holiday . <sssss> the album has a old-school feel to it with a new school vibe . <sssss> There is also a song with stephen marley that has a tight reggae melody to it . <sssss> The only reason I didnt 5 star this album is that there wasent more tracks like bag lady ( radio edit ) , or On & On but thats minor when you think about everything she was saying in this album . <sssss> If your looking for another soul album to add to your collection then this is it .
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B00004YKUI	5	When I first heard Erykah Badu 's " Mama 's Gun " , all I thought was : THIS A CLASSIC . <sssss> " Mama 's Gun " is just simply one of the best soul albums ever recorded . <sssss> There 's somuch raw emotion that 's polished but not glossed over . <sssss> Like a great Prince album , " Mama 's Gun " is very diverse . <sssss> From the punchy rock-tinged funk of " PenetarityPhilosphy " ( sp. <sssss> ) to the moody ballad " Did n't Cha Know " to the sincere beauty of " AD 2001 " ( a beautiful tribute to Amadou Diallo ) to the clever , sista-love anthem " Bag Lady " ( sorry radioheads the Dr. Dre-samplin ' version is n't here ) , Erykah pullsall stops . <sssss> Also some highlights on " Gun " include " Kiss Me On My Neck ( Hesi ) " and theso-pretty-it 's ugly acoustic ballad with Stephen Marley , " I 'm In Love With You " . <sssss> But what remains my personal all-time favorite on " Mama 's Gun " is " Time 's A Wastin ' " - which is one of the best slow songs I 've ever heard . <sssss> Not ever " Mama 's Gun " 's 10-minutebreakup tour de force , " Green Eyes " can touch the beauty of " Time 's A Wastin ' " ( atender ode to her son , Seven ) . <sssss> As a true soul lover , I 'm telling you " Mama 's Gun " is a must-have for ANY musicfan ! <sssss> " Who Is Jill Scott ? Words & Sounds Vol . 1 " , " Songs In A Minor " , and even AngieStone 's new one , " Mahogany Soul " are all 5-star but none can come close to the gun , Mama 's .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B00004YKUI	5	I know alot of people who did n't like this album and I ca n't figure out why . <sssss> Erykah is probadly the most bold R&B singer we have today . <sssss> What I mean is her approach to music puts her in the same class of Madonna . <sssss> She does n't try or want to repeat and this is why some people ca n't handle this wonderful album . <sssss> I purchase this album the same week it was out and I am still listening to it ( which is rare in today 's world ) . <sssss> My favorite songs " A.D. 2000 " ( which was penned for the slain Amadou Diallo ) , " Bag Lady " , " Time 's A Wastin " , " Orange Moon " and " Green Eyes " . <sssss> Another note , she was the artist that put a damper on Puffy Daddy 's night at the Grammy . <sssss> She shocked the industry by winning " Best R&B album " and her success has open the doors for India Arie , Jill Scott , and even Lauren Hill . <sssss> In that alone , she is a legend . <sssss> Open your eyes and ears to this excellent cd and this woman .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B00004YKUI	5	Like Motor Trend 's recently picked " 2001 Car of the Year " , the latest from Erykah Badu is a clever blend of the old and new . <sssss> With its cover photo reminiscent of those from 70 's legends Donny Hathaway or Roberta Flack , the entire album is like a time capsule that ca n't decide what era to represent . <sssss> And that is what truly makes this one of the best of 2000 . <sssss> The assembled songs show Badu the singer matched superbly by Badu the songwriter . <sssss> Some have the sound of works of Holiday ( Billie ) , Hayes ( Isaac ) , Vaughan ( Sarah ) or even Mayfield ( Curtis ) ; yet , they are presented in a way that only could be done by Badu . <sssss> The band subtly complements the singer and never overshadows her " cool " vocals . <sssss> To pinpoint any one song as a standout would be a gross injustice to the others for the " total package " works . <sssss> This is one " gun " that is truly LOADED !
A149OQJD0ASI07	B00004YKUI	4	You 've got to buy this album alongside OutKast 's " Stankonia " to really appreciate its brilliance . <sssss> For those that did n't know or do n't remember , Erykah had a relationship with OutKast 's Andre 3000 and had his son . <sssss> Both of these albums were released on the cusp of that heartache-filled , teary-eyed breakup . <sssss> OutKast put out arguably its biggest selling album ( at the time ) of its budding career and enjoyed crossover success with the real life-inspired , melodic " Ms. Jackson " , a tale of a baby daddy tryin ' 2 do right by his seed who tolerates being mistreated by his Ex and babymama 's mama for the good of the relationship with his seed . <sssss> Well , Erykah 's somewhat muttled , but clear rebuttle is a song " Bag Lady " that richly carries this emotional , soulful LP " Mama 's Gun " . <sssss> Reppin ' 4 woman scorned by a lover they thought they 'd always be with , Badu vividly paints a picture using a bag lady as a metaphor for the need to let go and move on ( song lyrics : " Bag Lady , You gon " hurt yo back ... dragging all them bags like that / I guess nobody ever told you / All you must hold onto , is you ) . <sssss> This is n't a happy album ... kinda like Mary J. Blige 's " My Life " . <sssss> But for those who 've REALLY lived life , this is one you 've got ta have in your collection for " those days " . <sssss> Also check for underrated treasures on this album " Green Eyes " ( breakout lyrics : My eyes are green b/c I eat lots of vegetables ... <sssss> It has nothing to do with who 's on your arm now ) and " Orange Moon " . <sssss> Got ta love the He Said , She Said relationship wars that are true to life and produce some of the best art from pain , misery , sorrow and shame . <sssss> This is one of those such LPs . <sssss> Recommended !
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00004YKUI	5	" Mama 's Gun " is an album of rare and unexpected depth . <sssss> While some in the r & b camp resort to tired formulas and worn cliches as a cheap route to credibility , Erykah Badu gives us the real thing . <sssss> Her second studio album has a potent mix of rock , funk , and jazzy soul layered around Badu 's gusty voice . <sssss> The disc 's track of note is the arrow-to-the-heart ballad " I 'm in Love With You " , a duet with Stephen Marley ( yes , THAT Marley , and he sounds just like Bob ) . <sssss> Other tracks of note are the 10 minute " Green Eyes " and the sincerity of " Time 's a Wastin ' " . <sssss> This album did n't flop on the charts , but its performance was disappointing compared to its debut . <sssss> That 's a shame , because " Mama 's Gun " is a startlingly great CD that reveals something new after each listen .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00004YKUI	5	This is the album I 've been waiting for all year ( D'Angelo came close but just missed the mark ) . <sssss> Filled to overflowing with passionate yet restrained vocals , addictive boom-bap rhythms , brilliant ensemble playing by a tight band led by the Roots Ahmir " ? uestlove " Thompson on drums and some of her most inventive lyrics ever , " Mama 's Gun " is the first certified masterpiece of the year 2000 . <sssss> There is simply so much wonderful music to be enjoyed here that I can scarcely contain my enthusiasm ! <sssss> Ms. Badu completely avoids any sophomore jinx and not only produces a solid follow-up , but manages to actually expand on the brilliance of her debut . <sssss> Special kudos to the production team for sequencing the album so flawlessly ( there are no breaks between the songs and the entire LP flows together from track to track without ever losing momentum ) . <sssss> While I prefer to think of this as a concept album of sorts , a few cuts from this would sound terrific on the radio ( " My Life " comes to mind and " Orange Moon " would fit in perfectly on the quiet storm ) , but there is simply no way to reduce the pleasures on this release down to just a few cuts , EVERYTHING here is worth hearing and it unfolds and deepens with every listen . <sssss> Very Highly Recommended , in fact it 's Essential !
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00004Z41Q	3	Nelly Furtado 's debut album , Whoa , Nelly ! <sssss> is just ok to me . <sssss> Unfortantely , I only love four songs which are : Hey Man ! <sssss> , ... On the Radio ( Remember the Days ) , I 'm like a Bird , and Turn off the Light . <sssss> The rest of the songs just did n't do anything for me . <sssss> I would buy her second album instead , Folklore . <sssss> That album is incredible , catchy , and brilliant . <sssss> I heard she is releasing a new album in June , ca n't wait for that . <sssss> I like her voice and her songwriting is pretty damn good but Whoa , Nelly ! <sssss> is just middle of the road to my ears .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00004Z41Q	4	What a surprise . <sssss> I woke up this morning and this was on my bedside , and it 's not even my birthday ! <sssss> Well anyways , first and foremost I must warn you not to be fooled by the cheesy cover . <sssss> This , of course , has elements of pop and was probably manufactured to be so , but she 's no Britney Spears and that 's a sigh of relief . <sssss> It carries top 40 material but I urge you to look past the dreadful , I 'm Like A Bird , to see this singer for the wonderous talent she really is ... Nelly Furtado is originally from Portuguese so creatively she blends her native world music in with today 's contemporary trip-hop , r & b , electronica , and even some rock and synthesizers . <sssss> It was n't until I heard her second single though , Turn Off The Lights , that she really caught my attention . <sssss> Now that I own Whoa , Nelly ! <sssss> I 'm saddened to think that many people hear her big hit and dismiss her of any real ability after that one song . <sssss> If only they 'd listen to the last track , Scared Of You , I 'd bet my money on them quickly changing their minds . <sssss> The Spanish guitar playing and the gypsy shaker flair with her transcendent vocals ( crystalline clear in the ending ) are just marvelous ... Another track that astounded me was the first song , Hey , Man ! <sssss> , with its beautiful string arrangments . <sssss> At first it vagually reminded me of Olive , but once she started singing it sounded a bit like Alanis Morissette - except for the vivacious chorus . <sssss> The electro , My Love Grows Deeper , and the sprightly throbbing Party are currently my favorites , alongside her next single ... ( my guess ? <sssss> ) ... . <sssss> On The Radio . <sssss> So what 's there left to do now than to buy this record ? <sssss> Just do n't expect anything serious from it and have fun with its wacky style fusion . <sssss> Bye now .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00004Z41Q	3	By now you would have heard her top 10 hit I 'm Like A Bird , knew her ethnicity which is chiefy Portuguese-Hindi-and more ... ? <sssss> , and liked her collaboration with Missy Elliot on Tom Radier 's Soundtrack . <sssss> For her 1st solo effort , Nelly wrote all the songs and sang them with wisdom seemingly beyond her age . <sssss> Her lyrics may be inane at times and her voice becomes indicipherable too . <sssss> However , the songs are somewhat different than those typically on Top 40 radio . <sssss> Her latest single is Turn Off The Light and man , this gal knows how to use the video genre to good effect . <sssss> Her videos are pretty visually stunning or wierd in some cases . <sssss> Perhaps , the key to Nelly 's success is her ability and affinity to be different .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00004Z41Q	3	I will be honest , I was curious of Nelly because of a review in Entertainment Weekly . <sssss> Now that I have heard Nelly Furtado sing I must say that the magazine gave her way too much credit . <sssss> At times I felt like I was listening to Gwen Stefani of No Doubt who too has a somewhat annoying voice . <sssss> Most of the songs on this album like " ... On The Radio ( Remember the Days " and " Baby Girl " I can get past the nail-on-chalkboard quality of Nelly 's voice but on songs like " Party " and " Well , Well " I thought I would have to stuff kleenex in my ears . <sssss> Amanda Ghost she is NOT ! <sssss> I would n't even put her on the same pedestal with Amanda Ghost .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00004Z41Q	4	I first saw Nelly Furtado singing her single " Like A Bird " on Saturday Night Live a month or so ago . <sssss> Never saw or heard of her before then . <sssss> When she sang ( and SNLs acoustics are never good ! <sssss> ) she sounded fantastic ! <sssss> I said who is this lady she is great ! <sssss> , unfortunately I forgot to write her name down , and forgot about her . <sssss> .... . <sssss> Than thanks to VH1 they started playing her video , and I said I really like this ladys voice , and I know I have seen her before , then my friend reminded me of SNL ... . <sssss> Well I ran out and bought the CD and it is a nice surprise . <sssss> Well produced , great talented voice , this lady has a future . <sssss> Though when I give an album 5 stars ALL the songs have to be great , so I give Nelly 4 because there are some fillers on the CD , a couple or so . <sssss> The CD cover brings me back to the 70s design . <sssss> Who ever her graphic artist was for this CD was very creative ... . <sssss> and the album is too ! <sssss> The Best New Artist for 2001 Grammies goes to ... . <sssss> NELLY FURTADO !
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B00004Z41Q	4	Nelly Furtado has to be one of the most interesting artists of the 2000 's . <sssss> Canadian born but with Portuguese roots which she proves in her music . <sssss> This album is a mix or Soul , R&B and just aswell some pop . <sssss> Nelly got a wonderful soulish voice that makes you interested in her work , the way she sings and makes the songs is a lot diffrent from the typical pop scene and that 's what makes this album special . <sssss> most quite easy listening songs , " Im like a bird " is a example . <sssss> " Turn off the light " might be a little more pop but still it feels original . <sssss> " Hey man " and " On the radio " are exellent songs too . <sssss> A few very slow songs are included too , " Scared of you " and " It will make you cry " is exactly the opposite . <sssss> This is more original and personal then most stuff about there and that 's what get 's my attention , the thing that she 's very talented and interesting is ofcourse a facor too . <sssss> Whoa nelly here you made a good album !
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B00004Z41Q	5	In the beginning , I knew this girl was special . <sssss> But her voice was kinda annoying . <sssss> However the more I listen to this cd , the more I like it . <sssss> Her production and songwriting are the true gems of this album . <sssss> I just had to get pass her voice , but I realize her voice is one of the layers what makes this album so good . <sssss> My favorite songs are the haunting " Scared Of You " , the funky " Remember The Days " and the fun " Baby Girl " . <sssss> This album has it all Latin , Hip Hop , Rap , R&B , Pop , and Rock . <sssss> If her debut is THIS good , I ca n't wait for her next album .
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B00004Z41Q	5	I am the one who wrote the scathing review of Ms. Furtado , comparing her to Britney Spears . <sssss> I was listening to I 'm Like A Bird for the 100th time on the radio when it hit me : this girl can really sing . <sssss> At times her voice is annoying , but others it 's beautiful . <sssss> I bought this CD and enjoy it thoroughly . <sssss> I feel like an idiot since I wrote a terrible review of this album before hearing all but one song , but I gave this chick a chance and I am glad I did .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00004Z41Q	5	Her songwriting and voice took the world by surprise when in 2000 , this daughter of a Brazilian came out with an album that sounds like the blend of Dido , Pink and Shakira with a touch of bossanova ( closer to Everything But The Girl than to Bashia ) . <sssss> Convoluted , you think ? <sssss> Well , it 's not . <sssss> Nelly broke some fresh ground with her debut album , " Whoa , Nelly " ! <sssss> most likely the result of an exclamation of an impressed fan ! <sssss> :) The matter of the fact is that , three years after the original release , it still retains a fresh sound . <sssss> It also shows how complete she is as an artist , one capable of not just singing and providing the looks ( which she has ) , but also of composing , producing and playing her own music and writing her own lyrics . <sssss> I hope this is not a one-album career , but rather the beginning of a fruitful and promising one that will give us many more works of the quality of her debut production .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B00004Z41Q	3	I was a litte disappointed when I listened to the entire disc . <sssss> Nelly has a fabulously unique voice , much like the phenom Macy Gray . <sssss> You definitely know it 's Nelly when you hear her . <sssss> The shining stars on this disc are obviously her charters , I 'm Like A Bird and Turn Out The Light . <sssss> I also liked Hey , Man ! <sssss> , but that 's about it . <sssss> Listen closely to her songs . <sssss> I noticed there is so much " noise " going on the background it detracts from her vocals . <sssss> By noise I mean added instruments and sounds that add no production value to the song . <sssss> I was a bit irritated by the quality of the material on this disc . <sssss> With a voice like hers , she really deserves better material . <sssss> Listen to Baby Girl , Legend and Trynna Finda Way and you 'll understand what I mean . <sssss> They get a ZONK ! <sssss> Sadly , my recommendation is that if you have the singles I 'm Like A Bird and Turn Out Light , you have all you need ... unless you can find it cheap you 'll be wondering why you spent the dough on this .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B00005M987	3	" Spirit Room " was our introduction to a teenage singer / songwriter by the name of Michelle Branch . <sssss> It 's a decent album with some stand-out tracks . <sssss> " You Get Me " is my personal favorite track . <sssss> It 's a beautiful ballad that I would 've loved to have been released as a single . <sssss> " All You Wanted " was the big hit and the reason I bought the album . <sssss> It was one of the best radio singles of 2002 . <sssss> " Everywhere " was a pretty big hit too and her first single , but it 's nothing really that special . <sssss> " Goodbye To You " was the third single and definitely another album highlight . <sssss> I like the album version better than the radio one . <sssss> " You Set me Free " and " Sweet Misery " are the other stand-outs on " Spirit Room " . <sssss> The rest of the songs are filler and not that great . <sssss> " Drop In the Ocean " could 've been good , but the way it 's mixed butchers the track . <sssss> Michelle Branch is talented and still has time to grow . <sssss> This was a fairly good debut . <sssss> " You Get Me " , " All You Wanted " , and " Goodbye To You " make it a worthy listen . <sssss> It 's worth checking out , just do n't be surprised if you find yourself skipping a few tracks .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B00005M987	4	Michelle Branch does n't get enough respect . <sssss> Although she has millions of fans who love her music , critics seem to love making rude remarks about her . <sssss> One critic even made fun of her for being the least sexual pop star in years ( like that 's a bad thing ) . <sssss> Well , that 's their problem . <sssss> Michelle Branch is a very talented young artist whose debut album sold millions of copies not because of massive marketing , but due to strong word of mouth . <sssss> She gets compared to a lot of other young artists such as Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton , but that is n't fair to any of those young women . <sssss> Each one has their own style and deserve credit for that . <sssss> This is a very good album . <sssss> The big hits off of the album still sound good today . <sssss> " Everywhere " was and still is a great song . <sssss> I remember the first time I heard " All You Wanted " . <sssss> I knew the song would be a hit because it was just so good , and although it was severely overplayed , it still holds up today . <sssss> " Goodbye to You " is pretty good , but the version here is n't as good as the radio version or the version she sang at the end of the Tabula Rasa episode on Buffy ( which is why I ca n't help but think of Tara and Willow each time I hear this song now ) . <sssss> As for the other songs , they are all pretty good . <sssss> I think she could have had a lot more hits off of this album . <sssss> I especially like " If Only She Knew " . <sssss> Some of the songs are a little poppy , but they are still good . <sssss> I recommend this album . <sssss> It is a strong debut from an underappreciated artist . <sssss> There are plenty of songs you can sing along to , and the songwriting is very good . <sssss> You will be glad you gave her a chance .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00005M987	4	Folk-style pop with a healthy dose of rock ! <sssss> Just the way I love it ! <sssss> That is definitely what Michelle Branch has going for her . <sssss> The only possible down side ? <sssss> She has gone where Jewel , Alanis , and Sheryl Crow have all gone many times before . <sssss> But , I love this music regardless ! <sssss> In fact , her voice reminds me of Sheryl 's , with a slight touch of Alanis ( especially on " All You Wanted " ) . <sssss> This album is a truly rare find - Why you ask ? <sssss> I do n't very often come across an album that is enjoyable from beginning to end ( meaning there are n't any songs that I would consider ' fillers ' ) . <sssss> I find myself liking every tune on this disc ( which never happens ) . <sssss> That 's a definite sign of a good album ! <sssss> And this is only her debut - I 'm interested in finding out how Michelle 's 2nd effort will fare . <sssss> Will she fall victim to the sophomore jinx ?? <sssss> I hope not , and I have a feeling that wo n't happen . <sssss> She seems to have the strong writing skills , an ear for great rhythms and melodies , and a very decent singing voice that are key to being a success . <sssss> Overall , a buy that is very much worth the money .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B00005M987	3	This album is pop rock with a little bit of folk . <sssss> It is n't as agressive as " Let Go " by Avril Lavigne . <sssss> The songs are mostly soft but catchy . <sssss> Michelle 's got talent and I 'm sure she 'll keep getting better . <sssss> My favorite songs are : All you Wanted , Here with Me , If Only She Knew , Goodbye to You , and I 'd rather be in Love . <sssss> The standout track is " All you wanted " .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00005M987	4	It 's pop , that is n't OVERLY poppy . <sssss> Somewhat like Vanessa Carlton . <sssss> I appreciate Michelle 's lyrics because they are just so true sometimes . <sssss> She 's a bit angsty , she 's left wondering and she longs for love ... in mildly interesting ways and it shows . <sssss> It 's just really nice to be able to truly relate to someone in the music industry . <sssss> I mean it happens , but not as often as we like sometimes . <sssss> And do n't get me started on John Shanks . <sssss> This guy is a musical genius . <sssss> He works with Michelle Branch on production and helps write five of the eleven songs on this nice full length debut . <sssss> He is also responsible for the catchiness of Ashlee Simpson songs , which most of them I love . <sssss> Best songs : All You WantedGoodbye To YouDrop In The Ocean ( this song is amazing ) Honorable Mention : Something To Sleep ToIf you do n't own any CDs by this talented singer/songwriter/guitarist / etc , etc . <sssss> It would be wise to start at the beginning with The Spirit Room . <sssss> The only thing that bothered me a bit was the song titles : Maybe I 'm in the minority , but some of them were just too predictable , leaving some of the songs to lack a bit of depth . <sssss> I believe Michelle was rather young when she wrote some of these songs though ... <sssss> Anyway , 4 stars ! <sssss> P . <sssss> S . <sssss> My favorite line is in the song Goodbye To You . <sssss> It 's capitalized : " I 've been searchin " deep down in my soul / Words that I 'm hearing are starting to get old / Feels like I 'm starting all over again / THE LAST 3 YEARS WERE JUST PRETEND ...
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00005M987	5	Michelle Branch 's debut album , The Spirit Room is a refreshing collection from an artist I never would have thought twice about listening to . <sssss> But I am glad I put my reservations aside and gave this album a chance . <sssss> To my surprise , all 11 tracks are strong and great . <sssss> Her voice can be a tad whiny and flat at times , but she plays guitar and writes some amazing music so that makes up for it . <sssss> Drop in the Ocean , All you Wanted , and If Only she Knew are my favorite tracks . <sssss> She shows great promise on Sweet Misery and Goodbye to You . <sssss> Her sophomore effort , Hotel Paper is not as good as The Spirit Room so I recommend getting this particular album instead , it 's more catchier than Hotel Paper .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00005M987	4	When I first heard " Everywhere " last year , I instantly fell in love with it , so of course I went to pick up the album . <sssss> There are enough songs on The Spirit Room to keep listeners happy . <sssss> There are not-too-fast , not-too-slow tracks like " Goodbye To You " ( which she says is her most personal song ) and " You Get Me " . <sssss> Also look out for the funky " If Only She Knew " , and original and invigorating production in songs like " Sweet Misery " ( with its Amy Grant-esque feel ) and especially " Here With Me " . <sssss> Michelle does n't let you down with the lyrics either . <sssss> There are good stories to be found in " Something To Sleep To " and the aforementioned " If Only She Knew " , and these tales are made even more interesting due to Michelle writing or co-writing all of the material . <sssss> Packed with creative lyrics , innovative production , and unique singing , The Spirit Room is 43 minutes of great music . <sssss> Nuff said .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00005M987	3	Michelle Branch is riding on the success of her first radio hit Everywhere , partly fueled by its appearance in American Pie 2 . <sssss> Ai n't no breaking new ground but she does serve a delicious dish of ppo / rock radio tunes that 's bound to make u sing along . <sssss> The fact that she 's from Madonna 's Maverick will inevitably draw comparisons with the label 's # 1 star Alanis Morissette , but Michelle has more of a clear , pristine voice . <sssss> She would appeal to the sub-teens and college kids ... Would love to see this lass mature , but it 'll take time ...
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00005M987	4	Between Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton , Michelle Branch seems to be the least annoying out of the three young artists whose music gives me cavities . <sssss> Yeah , their music beats listening to that chipmunk Britney Spears but overall I find their vocals a bit too high-pitched and their lyrics predictable and contrived for my tastes . <sssss> I really do not like " Everywhere " . <sssss> That song is probably the one song by Michelle that I could live without hearing for the rest of my life . <sssss> It was n't until Michelle 's second and third single off " The Spirit Room " that got me curious about her music . <sssss> " All You Wanted " and " Goodbye to You " are infectious little pop / rock songs that just got underneath my skin to a point of where I wanted to hear " The Spirit Room " . <sssss> And just as I expected , the music overall is too safe , predictable and frankly contrived at times but then again nothing could be worse than anything that Britney Spears and Aaron Carter puts out . <sssss> Blech ! <sssss> Despite the overproduction and how predictable the music is , I still enjoyed " The Spirit Room " . <sssss> I simply skip over the first track which I consider the weakest track on the album . <sssss> I particularly enjoyed the the ballads " Goodbye to You " and " Drop In the Ocean " , the latter being my favorite of the two . <sssss> Since Michelle is still a young artist , I definitely see a lot of potential in her and hopefully she will find her own niche and escape being lumped together with Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00005M987	4	Michelle Branch the latest teen to hit the pop world by storm is an artist that has a lot of room to grow , and the potential to have a lenghty career with the likes of Madonna , Natalie Merchant , Pat Benatar , etc . <sssss> Michelles first single " Everywhere " stormed onto the scene in 2000 , and Branch shows that her music roots and vocal range is no here today gone tomorrow pop sensation . <sssss> My beliefs are that Michelle Branch has a future . <sssss> She has a great look , a great sound , vocally she out does the Mariah wannabe Christina , out sings the monotone Minnie Mouse " Britney " , and shows she has a sense of cool style when it comes to fashion . <sssss> Michelle Branch has her own style - that winds around Natalie Merchant , to Six Pence , to Belinda Carlisle , to Joan Osborne , etc . <sssss> Michelle has a range and she plays it really well . <sssss> Branch comes off in her videos as just the girl next door who does n't need attitude ( Christina ) , torn clothing and gaudy make-up ( Britney ) or bleach blonde hair ( Jessica ) to have a career . <sssss> All she needs is her fresh looks , her gorgeous voice and her terrific talent to carry her for years to come . <sssss> Her album " The Spirit Room " is a fantastic well produced piece of pop that takes all forms . <sssss> Branch shows she can play with the heavyweights . <sssss> Her standout songs besides the single " Everywhere " are " You Get Me " , " Sweet Misery " and " Goodbye To You " to name few . <sssss> Branch 's album is first rate and shows that she has the talent to withstand these pop jokes Christina Aguilera , Britney Spears , Jessica Simpson and even the overrated Alicia Keys .
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B00005M987	3	Thanks to the mega-hit " All You Wanted " , Michelle Branch has enjoyed commercial success with her debut album , " The Spirit Room " . <sssss> While she may write her own songs and play guitar , most of the songs on this CD offer up nothing new and are as catchy as can be . <sssss> The difference , though , is that Michelle proves that having a hit song does n't mean you have to have manufactured vocals and snappy dance moves . <sssss> I think that Michelle has great potential as a songwriter and only once does she show how great she can be , on the song " Drop in the Ocean " . <sssss> While this album is n't spectacular , it 's an entertaining one and it shows the promise of this young woman .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00005M987	2	When you read through most of the reviews , the " natural " conclusion is that Michelle Branch is the next best thing after water . <sssss> Some people compare her to Alanis Morrisette . <sssss> The matter of the fact is that , even if sometimes she sounds as her Canadian label mate , Michelle is not breaking any new ground as Alanis did back in the mid nineties . <sssss> Her music ( radio-oriented as it is ) results entertaining indeed : songs such as " You Set Me Free " , " Something To Sleep " and " Goodbye to You " contain that something that characterizes pop music and appeal to a wide range of audiences , but they are far from original or deep . <sssss> Now , the album does close with a song that shows what Michelle Branch is truly capable of : " Drop in the ocean " has a distinct feel to it , calm in the beginning and then on to an upbeat rhythm that still retains a special quality different from the rest of the album , also showing her vocal capability ( parts of this song actually reminded me of Madonna ! <sssss> ) All in all , though , the album does n't help her enough . <sssss> I would n't buy it : I am glad that I got a copy from the library .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B00005M987	5	Branch was one of the first big music talents to emerge in a time when pop seemed to begin its nose-dive . <sssss> " Spirit Room " was a raw attempt to exploit the need for " real music " . <sssss> However , the music is extremely enjoyable . <sssss> " Everywhere " " You Get Me " " All You Wanted " and " Goodbye to You " are a few of the good tracks on this album . <sssss> I would recommend " Hotel Paper " for a more refined sound .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00005M987	3	The title of Michelle 's debut makes me believe that the songs included in this set are goin to be deep , but wassup with that ? <sssss> , Michelle 's Platinum Debut , has aproblem as the same for her second , the songs sound so much alike between one and the other . <sssss> Although the stand out cut is the angry-dramatic-in-love song " All You Wanted " , delivers just what we want to say to someone that we totally dig , plus the beats are just great , the first single " Everywhere " is among the other tracks that sound so much the same , guitar , band , in love , not in love , just average and ok , other track that could mention appart from the bunch is " If Only She Knew " a lyrical drvieb track , and a pleasure , I ddi n't get why they release " Goodbye To You " as the third cut , but maybe I do , because is different from the other , because is the most downtempo but does n't offer something atmospheric to cry about . <sssss> The last track of the album " Drop In The Ocean " is another odd , because has some electronic beats to it , but beside all this difference , mostly 8 tracks out of 11 sound just the same just different lyrics , it 's not a bad album , it 's just that the good beat and the fine formula repeats again and again , and just like something that is so repeptitive get 's burned .
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B00005NHJS	3	Mary J. Blige must have realized that the original version of her album , No More Drama , was getting mixed reviews . <sssss> Because this is a revised version of the album with two new songs , two remixes , and two songs thrown away . <sssss> These additional songs make all the difference in the world . <sssss> " He Think I Do n't Know " is a song that contradicts Mary 's album title because this song has plenty drama . <sssss> And the more drama the better . <sssss> This song takes you back to her Mary ( the album ) days with its bluesy feel . <sssss> " Rainy Days " featuring Ja Rule is an interesting song sure enough to win Ja more fans , if not only female fans . <sssss> " Dance For Me " is a lot like the original but this time Common 's rapping , which is an improvement over the uninspired rapping the other guy does in the original . <sssss> But the highlight is the title track remix , where Mary and P. Diddy are working together again . <sssss> Though neither of them give any mind-blowing performances , it is good to see that Mary lives up to the song 's name and puts her beef aside . <sssss> If only Blige would have gotten rid of the subpar songs like " Steal Away " and " Family Affair " , then this album would have almost been a classic . <sssss> Oh well , better luck next time .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B00005NHJS	4	I love me some Mary J. Blige but i must say I was quite disappointed by this release . <sssss> When I first listened to it I only liked about 2 songs so I put it in the book and forgot about it . <sssss> I jsut now picked it back up and it is better than when I first listened to it . <sssss> Heres a breakdown of each song : 1 . <sssss> Love - Tight way to begin the album I like this - 42 . <sssss> Family Affair - tight track by Mary even though it is a bouncy track it is still good . <sssss> hateration lol-53 . <sssss> Steal Away - Wack Beat dont like the vocals either-24 . <sssss> Crazy Games - Ok listenable-35 . <sssss> PMS - Tight track this is classic Mary J. Blige-56 . <sssss> No More Drama - Back to Back Classic tracks Amazing song-57 . <sssss> Keep It Moving - Average-38 . <sssss> Destiny - Wack-29 . <sssss> Where I 've Been ( featuring Eve ) - didnt like it at all-210 . <sssss> Beautiful Day - fourth lackluster track in a row and after two classics too.........-211 . <sssss> Dance For Me - Tight song another club type song-412 . <sssss> Flying Away - Average song more of a filler song than anything-313 . <sssss> Never Been - Classic-514 . <sssss> 2U - mediocre beat dont like the vocals either-315 . <sssss> In The Meantime - Another tight joint-516 . <sssss> Forever No More-good poem17 . <sssss> Testimony - excellent way to end sounds like it was left off of Mary-5Overall youre getting a mixed package . <sssss> Some really great songs sandwiched in between some particularly wack and filler songs . <sssss> It is worth purchasing though if you are a Mary fan . <sssss> This is a solid release for the Queen . <sssss> Buy this !
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B00005NHJS	3	I hate to compare music artists ' work to previous works but honestly I did just that with this project . <sssss> This was the first album of MJB 's that I did n't rush out and get on the release date . <sssss> I did not buy it till after ' NO MORE DRAMA ' was released as a single then after listening to it as a whole , I felt like this was a mini step backwards given how much I loved her previous album , ' Mary ' . <sssss> To this day , I really only bump 5 songs constantly : NO MORE DRAMA : one of the best modern r & b ; songs ever produced in my opinionSTEAL AWAY : love Pharrell 's vocals & the Neptunes production ; my only gripe ? <sssss> It 's too shortLOVE - banger , loved hearing her perform this live as well ! <sssss> FAMILY AFFAIR - this one had to grow on me but it 's a hot trackRAINY DAYZ - I just love this song , the beats are hot , JaRule sounds great as does MJBOther songs that I like but do n't listen to on the regular are : HE THINK I DO N'T KNOW - really soulful sound to her voiceNO MORE DRAMA ( remix ) - whereas the original is more of an uplifting anthem , this version makes me want to dance & is very upbeatNEVER BEEN - although Missy Elliot is all over this track & she 's not my favorite MC , I still enjoy this songThe others are somewhat enjoyable but not really memorable so I consider them more filler and skip them . <sssss> Like I said , as a fan , I 'm not really sure what MJB was trying to accomplish with this disc but I found it more of a " miss " than a " hit " but the massive success of the leading 3 tracks : ' FAMILY AFFAIR ' , ' NO MORE DRAMA ' , & ' RAINY DAYZ ' helped power the disc to multi-platinum status . <sssss> I can only recommend that die-hard fans get this disc otherwise download the tracks you like .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00005NHJS	5	Mary 's latest effort NO MORE DRAMA finds Mary in an upbeat , positive mood . <sssss> The aura flows from your speakers into your mind , leaving you with a positive vibe . <sssss> Just as the title says , no more drama , so save it for yo momma ! <sssss> It 's all about feeling good , having a good time . <sssss> Mary relates with fans on a personal level on songs like PMS ( feat . <sssss> Lenny Kravitz on guitar ) , No More Drama and Testimony . <sssss> You can get crunk with songs like Crazy Games , Family Affair , Dance With Me , and others . <sssss> There 's the love songs like the Missy produced Never Been , and the beautiful 2U . <sssss> The album features tracks produced by Dr. Dre , Missy , Neptunes , Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and more . <sssss> Go and pick up a copy , its well worth it , and stands as yet another strong album in the Mary J Blige library .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B00005NHJS	4	This new one from mary takes her back to the hard hip-hop / R + B sounds we know her for bu tin a new way . <sssss> She also goes into different kinds of beats this time around but for the most part this more uptempo to her last one . <sssss> This was supposed to be vol .2 to her last one but I guess they changed that name . <sssss> Now to check out whats good ... so what is ? <sssss> To start off the first track is tight and has a deep base line to start things off . <sssss> The tracks im feeling are : Love , Family Affair , Crazy games , Keep it moving , Where Ive been , Beatiful Day , Dance for me , Flying away , Never been , and 2U . <sssss> The song im really feeling is where ive been w / Eve . <sssss> I think that should be the next single . <sssss> It would take her to the top even more . <sssss> That is probably one of her most personal songs on the album . <sssss> When you really listen to the worse ... its taking about her life story and how she grew up . <sssss> Overall I would say its only 2 or 3 tracks I didnt liek but mary hit it hard . <sssss> Its a mix of soul and hip-hop beats but more on the hip-hop side . <sssss> Any mary or non-mary fan should check this one out .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B00005NHJS	5	The first time that I heard about Mary was when I bought the " Now 9 " cd in april 2002 and my favorite song was " Family affair " so I bought this album and let me just say that this album is great , songs such as : " Family affair " , " Love " , " Rainy dayz " or " No more drama " can really make you feel Mary 's gift for music . <sssss> This album hitted the charts twice , the first time was when the first edition was released , it debuted at # 2 and the second edition came out 8 months after peaking at # 14 , both were certified Platinum x2 . <sssss> Mary also won a Grammy in 2002 for this production . <sssss> If you like to dance I strongly recommend Mary 's remixes cd " Dance for me " .
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B00005NHJS	3	Mary J. Blige is one of the best soul vocalists of a gener-ation as her " My Life " and " Mary " albums proved . <sssss> So whereas " Mary " had quailty production , Blige 's latest " No More Drama " skids . <sssss> While tracks like " Family Affair " , " Steal Away " , " Crazy Games " , and the deep " Where I 've Been " ( featuring Eve ) are tight . <sssss> " No More Drama " is n't that devolped . <sssss> A lot of these songs aretired sounding and unoriginal . <sssss> But the title track is the album ' sand Mary 's best track . <sssss> Only on this song do we get theold-school rootiness , Mary displayed on " Mary " . <sssss> Other than that , buy this album for a couple tracks but not for gritty soul .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B00005NHJS	5	Deep and Personal , " No more drama " is defenitely one of Mary 's best album to date , she 's been the american queen of soul for a long time now but the latest few years she 's become a global world star aswell . <sssss> This album is not only classic soul however , some faster hip hop tunes and some funky samples included to make this album even more catchy . <sssss> The Neptunes appear on " Steal Away " where we can hear Pharell 's classic falsetto . <sssss> Missy appears on the ballad " Never Been " and Eve on catchy " Where i 've been " with some cool samples , " Dance for me " got it too and its simply one of the coolest songs on the disc . <sssss> If you like Dancing you got " Family Affair " but if you 're more interested in the deep sides of the album check out " No More Drama " or " Flying away " The album got it all , a new version was even made a year later with 2 new songs ( including " Rainy Days " with Ja Rule + a remix of " No more Drama " i can honestly do without that one , but this one however was one of my fav pics of 2001 . <sssss> Mary never makes you dissapointed .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00005NHJS	2	Mary J. Blige what Happen ? <sssss> after Her First Two Albums it 's been downhill since then . <sssss> yes She has had alot of Drama in Her Life but after awhile it gets Boring & Predictable & this Album is no different . <sssss> no matter who She is Working with the Formula is intact now . <sssss> Her Vocals do n't Move me much anymore . <sssss> Music & Lyrics do n't really go anywhere . <sssss> I 'd give this Album a 2 & half . <sssss> She has Moments but a whole far from her Best .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B00005NHJS	4	Mary J. Blige has always been a master at combining r & b and hip hop . <sssss> She was one of the first to put the two mediums together . <sssss> On her new album , No More Drama , she enlists the help of Dr. Dre , The Neptunes , Eve and Lenny Kravitz and serves up yet another winner . <sssss> " Family Affair " is the first single and it is a funk flavored track adeptly guided by Dr. Dre . <sssss> Mr. Kravitz provides an acoustic guitar on " PMS " which helps Ms. Blige branch out her sound . <sssss> The title track is an amazing piece of music in which she cuts loose on the vocals and producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis build it brilliantly around the theme to The Young & The Restless . <sssss> No More Drama is yet another great album from the queen of hip hop / soul .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B00005NHJS	5	As one who initially dismissed Miss Blige as a " flash-in-the pan " , I am one who will admit the he erred in his original assessment of the singer . <sssss> I have become one of Mary 's most ardent fans , having purchased her last three studio releases . <sssss> The latest , " No More Drama " finds Mary triumphantly satisfying her legion of admirers with a very " tight " collection of radio-friendly and party-ready jams . <sssss> One of the business 's most accomplished lyricists and performers , the singer triumphs with a 17-song album of love , reflection , and street-savvy songs that will , no doubt , bring her another platinum-selling release . <sssss> Best cuts are the hit " Family Affair " , " PMS " , with a sample from the popular theme from " The Young & The Restless " , the title cut , " Beautiful Day " , " Flying Away " , and " 2U " , a magnificent cut with Mary soaring on leads and background vocals . <sssss> Blige moves into Maya Angelou territory with the poem " Forever No More " , an inspirational assessment of the artist as woman and survivor . <sssss> While her last two albums , ` 99 's " Mary " and " Share My World " from ' 97 , were slightly more pop-oriented , " No More Drama " is more like her earlier works . <sssss> This proves that the artist is one who craftily mixes both " schools " , the old and the new . <sssss> She is bordering on legendary status . <sssss> For that , we listeners should be most grateful .
A149OQJD0ASI07	B00005NHJS	3	I love me some Mary J. Blige and this album was n't bad , just her weakest in her portfolio . <sssss> But what was she thinking with this cover ? <sssss> Does that look cool ? <sssss> Was that some art director 's idea of unique even in 2001 ? <sssss> Okay , okay , back to the album ... <sssss> I 'm hatin ' on this offering from Mary for one reason -- this is her first album I 've EVER had to skip songs on . <sssss> Mary 's trying her hand on this LP at more songwriting & more power to her for trying to add skills , but avoid TRACK 8 ( Where I 've Been featuring Eve ) and TRACK 9 ( Beautiful Day ) with all abandon !!! <sssss> She re-released this album in spring 2002 with new songs and a slightly different arrangement . <sssss> I personally would recommend getting THAT version instead ( it 's got all of her hit singles , No More Drama and Family Affair along with a track she later won a grammy for , " He Think I Do n't Know " which is vintage Mary ) . <sssss> Crazy Games , also not a bad track at all on this album version , gets replaced on the re-release . <sssss> The re-release also has a dance-track version remix of No More Drama ... another reason I suggest buying the second version first . <sssss> Overall , again , this is n't a bad album ... <sssss> I 'd buy this before anything from Keyshia Cole , Ashanti , Teairra Marie , Olivia , Sharissa , etc . <sssss> It 's just this is definitely NOT up to Mary J. Blige 's usual standards of greatness .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B00005NHJS	5	I had n't listened to this CD for a while for some reason . <sssss> Boy was I missing out ! <sssss> This is one of , if not my absolute , favorite Mary J. albums . <sssss> It is truly beatiful . <sssss> Her vocals on here are wonderful , the production is great . <sssss> Every single song is great ! <sssss> I actually like the original version a little bit better . <sssss> I would recommend finding the original and buying it along with this one . <sssss> This re-release is still great and the new songs keep the quality and integrity of the album . <sssss> ( That is very rare with re-issues . <sssss> ) I definitely recommend this , along with the original if you can find it . <sssss> This is one of my all time favorite albums .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00005NKYQ	1	I applaud this chick for making a remake of Bonnie and Clyde 97 . <sssss> But she wish it had half the Heart and Soul that Eminem possessed in early 2000s . <sssss> She tries to prove a point , but falls flat on her azz . <sssss> She is one of the most well-known and " respected " quirky singer-songwriters , but I felt empty listening to the final throws . <sssss> Skip this , and say that You thoroughly Enjoyed it . <sssss> Then get into deep Conversation , about how this particular album moved you , and re-arranged Neptune and Venus , in the pale , blue sky .1 star . <sssss> Piss-poor attempt .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00005NKYQ	4	Strange Little Girls by Tori Amos is my least favorite album from the Goddess of Weird . <sssss> The pictures are beautiful and intriguing though . <sssss> Standout tracks include : New Age , 97 Bonnie and Clyde , Strange Little Girl , Enjoy the Silence , Real Men , and Rattlesnakes . <sssss> The rest of the tracks never had a significant impact on me . <sssss> Just to give you forwarning , all the tracks are covers originally performed by male artists . <sssss> No original Tori tracks here , that 's probably why the songs do not resignate with me . <sssss> This album is odd but I give credit to Tori for trying something different and outside the box . <sssss> A lot of cover albums are not that good but at least this album is not totally unlistenable . <sssss> This album takes some time to warm up to but her cover of Joe Jackson 's Real Men is the most perfect track she has ever recorded , it 's brillant . <sssss> Take it or leave it , you will either love it or despise it but Tori is a genius on her own so remember that . <sssss> Best Tori albums : From the choirgirl hotel , Scarlet 's walk , and The Beekeeper .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B00005NKYQ	5	Tori Amos is one tallented and creative artist . <sssss> On this 2001 release she decided to sing songs writen by male artists and to sing them from a female perspective and it does work and does not sound forced or phony . <sssss> I love her vocals and she is also a very beautifull woman and the photos in the book-let atest to this as she is dressed in different outfits as to be different personas like the cop , the showgirl and many others . <sssss> The production value on this album is quite good and the sounds , vocals and the beats all sound like they have been handpicked which makes a world of a difference then if an artist have picked the wrong sounds . <sssss> This is a very nice cover album and should not be missed by fans of Amos or good music for that matter . <sssss> This is an album not to be missed .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00005NKYQ	3	After two supremely fine efforts in FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL andTO VENUS AND BACK , Tori Amos once again feels the need to challenge , and the result is this ultimately flawed collection ofcover songs . <sssss> It 's no secret that this was conceived as a concept album , the concept being songs written by men , but now interpreted from a woman 's point of view . <sssss> Unfortunately , the concept fails more often than not . <sssss> The most talked about track here is her spoken-word reading of Eminem 's '' 97 Bonnie and Clyde ' , which admittedly takes on an even more horrific slant in Amos ' hands . <sssss> It 's quite powerful , but the stark brutality of the song 's story does n't hold up to repeated listenings . <sssss> She also delivers a snooze-inducing take on Depeche Mode 's ' Enjoy The Silence ' , not one of there better singles to begin with , and made even more unbearable here , and she manages to reduce the oft-covered ' I 'm Not In Love ' to an ominous , utterly depressingemotion killer . <sssss> On the positive side , her cover of the Stranglers ' ' Strange Little Girl ' is sterling , easily the best thing here and actually ranking among her overall best work . <sssss> In fact , the few successes here are actually the uptempo tunes , chief among them ' Rattlesnakes ' and ' Heart of Gold ' . <sssss> Though not the potential career-killer that the disastrous BOYS FOR PELE almost was , overall this will rank in the long-run as an ambitious but ultimately inconsequential set for Amos .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00005NKYQ	2	I hate writing bad reviews - especially for my favorite artists - but this album is Tori 's worst to date . <sssss> It is so below her potential and I 'm really disappointed . <sssss> Despite the obvious downfall of her last album , TO VENUS AND BACK , I enjoyed it a lot more than this . <sssss> This is horrible with little saving it from disasterous results . <sssss> " New Age " is a fairly new approach for Tori Amos with more of a shoegazing trip-hop sound to it while her re-make of Eminem 's " '97 Bonnie & Clyde " is disturbing though strangely effective . <sssss> Her first single " Strange Little Girl " is still not the best of Tori 's ability but for all us long-time fans it hits a little closer to home - as does " Rattlesnakes " . <sssss> The only song that I was really impressed with was the chilling re-make of " I 'm Not In Love " , which also has a trip-hop feel to it . <sssss> " Heart Of Gold " is also an ok song with her voice rising with the building guitars , but the way that she sings on that song quickly diminishes all good feelings as it soon becomes annoying . <sssss> I just think that this whole album is monotonous and dull . <sssss> Hopefully next time she wo n't feel so pressured by her record company to produce an album and will once again be creative with the human word and write her own songs instead of doing covers of other groups ( ... primarily males ) . <sssss> I also think that she could have chosen some better songs to play with for I 've heard her do some amazing re-makes before so I know that she can do a lot better than this ... Now I 'm not gon na say that she 'll never again reach the perfection of " Little Earthquakes " or " From The Choirgirl Hotel " but from the looks of it she 's currently falling into an abyss of difficulty which I 'm hoping will soon improve .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00005NKYQ	4	It 's a pity that Tori never achieved the kinda success that she could have gotten . <sssss> A talented songwriter-producer and a superb singer by all means . <sssss> Nonetheless , Tori has garnered for herself critical acclaim through her 6 studio albums . <sssss> Her latest Strange Little Girls is presumably a contract filler now that she 's left Atlantic Records for a new home . <sssss> Just look at the lack of promo on the record company 's part . <sssss> In fact , Atlantic has never been effective in breaking Tori to the masses , but it 's ok cos Tori keeps on pushing the boundaries and gives us good music amid the trash that 's around . <sssss> This is an all-covers album , featuring remake of tracks that were sung by men specifically . <sssss> Standouts include Strange Little Girl , I Do n't Like Mondays and Rattlesnakes . <sssss> Tori 's remake of Eminem 's Bonnie & Clyde 97 is so good it rivals the original with Tori 's whispering spoken words that brings out the chilling effect of the song . <sssss> Despite this being a filler album , it 's by no means a weak shoddy effort ( like a lot of albums out there now ) , though definitely not Tori 's best . <sssss> SLG is not without its weaknesses . <sssss> The slow remake of 10CC 's I 'm Not In Love pales in comparison with another made by electronic group Olive in 2000 . <sssss> Overall , a great album to listen and understand .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00005NKYQ	5	On STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS , Tori covers songs , and sings them from a woman 's perspective . <sssss> In each song she plays the role of a different woman , which is why there are all the pictures of the women in the booklet of the CD . <sssss> Honestly this is one of her best albums yet , as she keeps getting better with each one , it surpassed any expectations I had for the album . <sssss> The songs that struck me the most were I Do n't Like Mondays , 97 Bonnie & Clyde ( very haunting ) , Real Men , Time and I 'm Not In Love . <sssss> Every song is excellent . <sssss> I worry with cover albums and cover songs that the new versions will try to surpass the originals by changing elements of the song , therefore changing it entirely . <sssss> After hearing these songs , I was n't worried . <sssss> Tori did these songs in her own way , making hers different from the originals , without taking away from the uniqueness of her own song or the original versions . <sssss> The good thing is with each song she plays a different role . <sssss> She really gets into those roles . <sssss> Because each role is different , each song is different too , but they all lead into each other very well . <sssss> Overall STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS is a winner in my opinion , and a must have for all fans of Tori 's music , as well as anyone who might be curious , wanting to join the quirky wacky world of Tori Amos ' music .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00005NKYQ	5	Tori Amos ' new album STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS is quite a surprise . <sssss> A collection of cover songs , sung from a woman 's perspective . <sssss> This is Amos reinterpreting touchstones by the likes of The Beatles , Neil Young and , yes , Eminem , all in an effort to entirely re-contextualise their meanings across gender . <sssss> There are 12 photos , one character for each song that Tori takes over . <sssss> There are four album covers to choose from as well , of four of the characters ( note I have the Strange Little Girl character as the cover The haunting '97 Bonnie and Clyde is a big standout on the album , very haunting with horror like music in the background with Tori taking over the role of the woman in the song , definately one of the best tracks on here . <sssss> My favorite however is I 'm Not In Love , beautifully done . <sssss> All the songs are good choices for the album . <sssss> The epic Happiness is a Warm gun is another fine standout on the album , clocking at almost 10 minutes . <sssss> Other notables include Time , Raining Blood , Strange Little Girl and Real Men . <sssss> All the tracks are wonderful and lead into each other beautifully . <sssss> Needless to say , STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS is n't always easy listening , but , as is the case with most of Amos ' oeuvre , if you 're willing to go there with her , you 'll be rewarded handsomely in the end . <sssss> Once again Tori continues to impress fans and people alike , with her unique music style that continues to grow and explore musical boundaries with each release .
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B00005NKYQ	5	At first I was disappointed that Tori 's new album would be a collection of covers and not original material , but after hearing Strange Little Girls , my disappointment went away . <sssss> The album is generally mellow , with the exception of Strange Little Girl ( brilliant ) and Heart of Gold ( which I ca n't stand ) . <sssss> My favorite song is Time , which is absolutely beautiful . <sssss> My only complaint is that Tori 's voice does n't have the power it once had . <sssss> She sounds like she 's singing in whispers and when she does try to sing in a powerful tone her voice is hoarse and tired . <sssss> If you 're new to Tori Amos this is n't the album to buy , but longtime fans who are open to hearing songs Tori did n't write should be happy with this .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00005NKYQ	3	This time around Tori comes to us with a strange little album with a sinister character , made up of experimental versions of very popular songs interpreted by her . <sssss> While I think she did a great job with " Happiness is a warm gun " ( extended and incredible cover , with samples taken from speaches by Bush ) and " Real Men " , I do n't feel the same way with the work she did on songs such as " Enjoy the Silence " and " Heart of Gold " . <sssss> It 's an album about which I have mixed feelings , and as an experiment , I do n't consider it successful , but as with most things , not all of it is good or bad . <sssss> It 's not Tori 's best album , that I can tell you . <sssss> One interesting side-thing about the album are Neil Gaiman 's comments to each of the photos ( one per song ) . <sssss> For those new to her music , check out her first two albums , ' Little Earthquakes ' and ' Under the Pink . <sssss> '
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00005NKYQ	3	I originally was not going to buy this CD . <sssss> There are very very few guy fans of Tori Amos , and I am one of them . <sssss> I listen to any musician that can play the piano well in rock music . <sssss> And i 've always known she was somewhat of a femenist , but it just got pushed too far for me on this album , so i had originaly decided not to get it . <sssss> Then i listened to the first couple of tracks on the listening station . <sssss> I was very curious to see her rendition of " 97 Bonnie and Clyde " , originally by Eminem , in which he kills his wife , stuffs her in the back of his car , and dumps her in a body of water . <sssss> This track scared the heck out of me , more than eminem could ever do . <sssss> Its haunting , disturbing , uneasy , etc . <sssss> This album is worth that track alone , but there are some other tracks that are good , while some are just alright . <sssss> Compared to Tori 's other albums , i wouldnt choose this album over From the Choirgirl Hotel or Boys for Pele , but i still think its a solid album you should get .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B00005NKYQ	1	Tori Amos ' Strange Little Girls is an interesting concept . <sssss> It is an album of cover songs . <sssss> The songs are all originally performed by men and in most cases they deal with women poorly . <sssss> Ms. Amos has covered unusual songs before like a quiet , acoustic version of " Smells Like Teen Spirit " . <sssss> The problem with Strange Little Girls is that in reversing the perspective of the songs from male to female , they loose their meanings and power . <sssss> " New Age " is an old Velvet Underground song about using a woman for pleasure . <sssss> Ms. Amos ' version loses the callousness that the Velvet 's were trying to convey . <sssss> " '97 Bonnie & Clyde " is an Eminem song where he dumps his ex-wife 's dead body in lake . <sssss> It sung to his daughter and he tells of how he will always be there for her . <sssss> By singing it from the mother 's point of view , it lessens the frightening lengths that a father would go to keep his daughter and turns it into a lament . <sssss> " I Do n't Like Mondays " was based on a true story of a girl who snapped and shot up her school in England . <sssss> The Boomtown Rats ' original had a sense of gravity underneath the airy arrangement . <sssss> Ms. Amos ' version reduces the violence to a cartoonish nature and you never get to the core of the song . <sssss> Ms. Amos gets points for the idea of the album , but she fails in the execution .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00005QDVS	5	Jewel 's This Way is my favorite album by her . <sssss> It is so different than her previous work and 0304 . <sssss> Standout tracks include : the sarcastic Jesus Loves You , the sensual Break Me , the sassy Love me just leave me alone , and a spectacular live recording of Sometimes it be that way . <sssss> Her lyrics are at its best here , her beautiful voice still gives me goosebumps when she effortlessly holds certain notes . <sssss> Grey Matter is a song of unavoidable passion : " I am drifting without an anchor through your ambiguous region , strange continent immune to all reason and i 'm flattered by your grey matter " . <sssss> The song Everybody needs somebody sometimes is so darn precious i ca n't help but grin when i hear this song : " Hey there honeybee will you give me sugar and if you shake real cute i might give you some sugar " . <sssss> Jewel is a timeless artist . <sssss> I love her live versions because they show her true talent as a singer and guitarist . <sssss> Great songs , catchy melodies , and lovely arrangements . <sssss> This Way is an album not to be missed .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00005QDVS	4	Three years on since her last studio effort SPIRIT , Jewel unleashes what is arguably her most musically straightforward record yet with THIS WAY . <sssss> She abandon 's the lush piano arrangements of SPIRIT in favor of a more acoustically textured set , resulting in a far more upbeat affair than her previous albums . <sssss> Some credit I 'm sure goes to Nashville producer Dann Huff , who gives the songs a glossy backdrop , and while there 's nothing here approaching " country " , some of the tracks here would n't sound out of place on what constitutes country radio playlists these days . <sssss> What has n't changed so much is Jewel 's way with a lyric -- she continues to be somewhat sophomoric in her approach to the human condition , often saying very little in the length of an entire song . <sssss> She 's far better with a melody , adding wonderful hooks to tracks like the terrific ' Standing Still ' and the title track . <sssss> She also attempts a Janis Joplin channeling on the ( ... ) blues rocker ' Love Me , Just Leave Me Alone ' . <sssss> From start to finish , this constitutes the artist 's most consistent effort .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B00005QDVS	5	Not only is Jewel drop-dead gorgeous , but she also possesses musical talent beyond belief . <sssss> How lucky can one person get in life ? <sssss> It 's fun to watch Jewel on VH1 or MTV as she gives a tour of her lavish house , shows us her horse , and talks sincerely to her boyfriend on her cell phone . <sssss> She is at once a modern woman and a throwback to the age when women had a sense of innocence - and were proud to display it . <sssss> But I digress severely . <sssss> This record is the best of Jewel 's career . <sssss> She 's taken on a more rockin ' path , and the results are unbelievable , almost on par with someone like Bonnie Raitt ( another female musical genius ) . <sssss> I 'm outta ' here . <sssss> Enjoy Jewel 's latest . <sssss> PEACE OUT !!!!!!!! 
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B00005QDVS	4	I 've listened to Jewel 's music since before " You Were Meant for Me " made her a household name . <sssss> Even though her sophomore album Spirit was about as hard to stomach as a 12-course meal of pure molasses , This Way represents a great improvement of Jewel 's musical arc . <sssss> Ditching the behind-the-times arrangements of Spirit producer Patrick Leonard , Jewel opted to work with rock veteran Dann Huff who , while weaving no breakthrough sound textures , gives her a steady rock backing and toughens up her sound . <sssss> Lead single " Standing Still " is easily her best song since the plaintive " Adrian " from Pieces of You , and certainly her hardest-hitting , a great car-radio song . <sssss> Jewel 's singing has improved dramatically , utilizing much less of the sugary sweetness , letting the mid range of her voice soar , quite commandingly . <sssss> While the rhythm section is sometimes weak -- the drumming on " Everybody Needs Someone Sometime " ranks among the worst I 've ever heard -- and Jewel waxes too " country " at points with mixed results , This Way is still quite a strong record , proving that when Jewel reins in her sentimentality and applies that muscular voice to rawer material and tougher arrangements , she is definitely a contender .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00005QDVS	5	This is my favorite Jewel album . <sssss> The lyrics are n't too meandering ( or at all ) and the music is just nice and reflective . <sssss> The ballads are what work best here . <sssss> The title track is one of my favorites , even though in the liner notes she said she hated singing it . <sssss> " I Wont Walk Away " is a nice jazzy kind of ballad . <sssss> A lot of people do n't like " Cleveland " because it 's " too country " , but I love it . <sssss> I 'd actually like to see her do a true country album . <sssss> " Till We Run Out Of Road " and " Do You Want To Play " are other great ballads . <sssss> A lot of people love " Serve The Ego " , but I could take it or leave it . <sssss> " Love Me , Just Leave Me Alone " is EXCELLENT . <sssss> " Break Me " and " Standing Still " were great singles too . <sssss> Overall a solid collection of music .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00005QDVS	3	Have n't I heard this album before ? <sssss> ... . <sssss> Oh , yes this sounds like " Spirit " . <sssss> Jewel is a wonderful singer , with her own style , however she has put it right back into her latest effort " This Way " . <sssss> There are no surprises , just the same Jewel , singing the same songs , with the same monotone , the same hooks , the same guitar strings , the same production , the same arrangement ... shall I go on. <sssss> If you have " Spirit " save your money . <sssss> If you do n't have " Spirit " buy " This Way " , its the latest from Jewel however the same album as her last . <sssss> Her first single " Standing Still " is one of the weaker songs on this album . <sssss> Still a good effort , but I just wish Jewel would try some other direction then the same one . <sssss> " This Way " is a safe bet to keep the " Spirit " in check .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B00005QDVS	5	On Jewel 's third album , THIS WAY , we find the singer / songwriter moving further away from the folk music she made on previous album and into a more mainstream pop / rock sound . <sssss> " Standing Still " was an excellent choice for first single , definately a standout on the album . <sssss> " Serve The Ego " was the second single , not a favorite , but it was a big hit with its club remixes . <sssss> Perhaps foreshadowing her even more obvious attempt at pop on her newest disc 0304 . <sssss> Other than subtle changes in sound , not much has changed with Jewel . <sssss> The songs are still introspective , and endearing . <sssss> I think the ballads are what really make this album , songs like " Till We Run Out Of Road " , " Do You Want To Play " , " I Wo n't Walk Away " and the title track stand as standouts . <sssss> " Break Me " is absolutely beautiful and shows her beautiful voice . <sssss> She shows she can rock out on songs like " Love Me , Just Leave Me Alone " . <sssss> Other highlights include " The New Wild West " , and the two live tracks " Grey Matter " and " Sometimes It Be That Way " . <sssss> Overall , a strong album that does n't disapoint .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B00005QDVS	3	All right , I thought Jewel was something unique when her debut " Piece Of You " was released . <sssss> She had a sound all her own , and I thought there was going to be some exciting future material to hear from her . <sssss> But , with her second cd , " Spirit " it seemed this unique talent would have to wait . <sssss> Now , with " This Way " Jewel appears to be heading in a more pop direction , less folky than her first cd . <sssss> She seems to be making music for the masses , and I am not sold on her new release . <sssss> I ca n't remember any of the tracks other than " Standing Still " and this was the same problem I had with " Spirit " which only had " Hands " . <sssss> Since I but a lot of music each year , I expect something more than a sing-by-numbers approach to music making . <sssss> Will Jewel ever deliver the goods and make a cd that pairs her unique style with music that complements it ? <sssss> Not this time anyway .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B00005QDVS	2	After hearing Jewel 's new album " This Way " in its entirety for the first time , I did n't really know what to make of this album ... <sssss> I 've listened to the album several more times since , and must report unfortunately that my initial reaction still stands . <sssss> It 's been 3 years since " Spirit " came out , and one would think that that is plenty of time to assemble strong tracks . <sssss> However , nowhere on " This Way " will one find the 1-2-3 knockout punch of Spirit 's Deep Water / What 's Simple is True / Hands ( " Simple " is Jewel 's best song ever , period ) . <sssss> The opening track ( and first single ) is " Standing Still " , which is what I wish Jewel would have done , rather than looking for a " new sound " such as on " Everybody Needs Someone Sometime " , a truly bland , Shania Twain-like Nashville-flavored song . <sssss> And then to have " Cleveland " for us Cincinnatians , ouch that hurts ! <sssss> Surprisingly , the best tracks on the album are the 2 live " bonus " tracks , both of which is just Jewel solo on accoustic guitar , reminiscent of the " Pieces of You " album : on " Grey Matter " , THE stand-out on the entire album , Jewel 's vocals truly shine ; on " Sometimes It Be That Way " Jewel points out in the liner notes that " the false start at the beginning is me forgetting the lyrics " . <sssss> Beautiful ! <sssss> The rest of the album could 've used some more spontaneous moments and intimate songs like these . <sssss> In sum , a very uneven and overlong ( 60 min . <sssss> ) album , reminding us at the very end why we have come to like Jewel in the first place . <sssss> Jewel of old , come back ! <sssss> All is forgiven ! 
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B00005QDVS	3	Jewel has a little harder edge to her sound for her third album , This Way . <sssss> That 's not to say she has abandoned her elemental folk sound , it 's just been kicked up with a rock edge . <sssss> The first single , " Standing Still " is a great example of the new sound as is the title track . <sssss> " Love Me , Just Leave Me Alone " has a 70 's Faces riff and is easily the most rocking Jewel has ever gotten . <sssss> But she does n't completely change her sound as " Break Me " is classic Jewel . <sssss> It is a stark ballad in the vein of a " Foolish Games " and the best song on the album , " I Wo n't Walk Away " is awash in strings and pianos and the lyrics are poignant and deep .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00005QDVS	4	This is a rock album period . <sssss> Jewel attempted to return to the " not overproduced flavor " of " Pieces Of You " , but not letting all the live acoustic get too much in the music . <sssss> The album is a easy goin ' album , although is not the best album of Jewel out of the 4 that have been release , it has all that special moments that make it worth buying it . <sssss> The best track is the title one " This Way " , " Standing Still " the leading single is a fast goin ' all time rock song , that gets better at the end . <sssss> " Break Me " the second single was way too corny , that 's why radio airplay did n't click , " Serve The Ego " is out of place , should belong to " 0304 " , the song is good , " ... . underneath the disco lights ... " great lyrics , fav one , " Jesus Love You " catchy song , " Do You Want to Play " ? <sssss> , should had been realese as a single , short , catchy , upbeat , great lyrics , the other tracks are ok , but the last tracks of the album became kind of a filler joints . <sssss> Although not Jewel 's best album , it 's worth it , more than many try to be rock albums of today ( like Michelle Branch ) . <sssss> Buy It .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00005QW3E	3	When your very first single becomes a # 1 hit , people are very quick to deem you as a one-hit wonder . <sssss> " Torn " was more than enough to have people run to the music store and pick up Left Of The Middle . <sssss> But after releasing several followup singles with little success , as well as disappearing from the mainstream for almost three years , the one-hit wonder tag seemed to fit Natalie Imbruglia perfectly . <sssss> But that tag was put to rest after hearing " Wrong Impression " , the first single off her latest album White Lilies Island . <sssss> The song is n't a hit per se , but it 's making a mark on the charts . <sssss> And there are other songs on this album that stand out as well . <sssss> There 's the easy-listening and somewhat painful " Goodbye " and the funky " Satellite " , not to mention the mesmerizing " Talk In Tongues " . <sssss> Artists like Natalie Imbruglia often have something of a philosophy in their lyrical style , and that sometimes may not come off as well as planned . <sssss> Almost comparing mixed love feelings to stomach surgery like in " Butterflies " is a little too out there , and " " Do You Love ? <sssss> " " is kind of all over the place ( and so is the production ) . <sssss> Also , the tempo of " " That Day " " sounds like it should have been sung by a group like Kittie . <sssss> She does n't sing it like a hard-rocker would or anything , but that 's the way it SHOULD sound ; thus she probably should 've given it to someone else . <sssss> Although it took a few years before Natalie re-emerged , she did do a pretty decent job . <sssss> Let 's just hope she does n't take that long to come back for album three .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00005QW3E	5	I could n't believe my eyes when I first saw the video for " Wrong Impression " . <sssss> The voice sounded so familiar yet I could n't put a name to the face . <sssss> I was even late to school because I had to catch the name . <sssss> She 's done a complete turnaround on her sophmore release and I give her a thousand props for it . <sssss> This is truly a remarkable comback after the unexpected success of her first album , Left Of The Middle , which dims in comparison to this . <sssss> She has n't just matured with her features but her music has definitely grown as well . <sssss> I was especially impressed with the Cardigan-esque " Goodbye " and " Do You Love Me " ? <sssss> where her voice resembles that of Nina Persson , particularly on the verses . <sssss> This is hands down one of the best Pop Rock albums ( so far ) of 2002 . <sssss> Never before has Natalie Imbruglia sounded so spectacular . <sssss> " Hurricane " evokes deep emotions with incredible lyrics that were obviously thought-provoking while " Sunlight " is absolutely splendid with its altering from piercing guitar to sometimes subtle rhythms . <sssss> I especially like the part where she briefly laughs . <sssss> Another personal favorite , though , would have to be " Talk In Tongues " where she croons softer than usual without the drowning of instruments . <sssss> So if you 're reading this right now than I advise you to give me a helpful vote and then to buy the record if you have n't already . <sssss> It 's honestly that good . <sssss> I promise .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00005QW3E	4	If you thought Torn was the best single off Left Of The Middle , shame on you . <sssss> You 've missed quite a lot ' cos there were so much more elsewhere on Middle that did n't bear the Torn sound . <sssss> For her US return , RCA opted to release the 2nd international single Wrong Impression as the leadoff for the US . <sssss> Clever decision cos the song is friendly and laden with hooks and a very catchy chorus . <sssss> But make no mistake the radio-hit ai n't Torn part II ; it 's in fact more refreshing and even sounds straight off The Sundays ' pan . <sssss> Again , it 's not the strongest track off White Lilies Island . <sssss> The international 1st single That Day co-written by frequent Madonna collaborator Patrick Leonard is a surprisingly rock-edged song that really works into you with each listen . <sssss> Pity the US radio will never take to it due to their overrding obcession with playing trite urban / rock tracks . <sssss> Beauty On The Fire is a nice song that turns on the trip-hop beat , Two of the best songs on the album Goodbye and Hurricane features very mature songwriting and frankly poignant , especially with Goodbye which starts off with a melancholic mode and works into a rock track later on . <sssss> Do You Love and Sunlight return some of the former Imbruglia sound . <sssss> Overall , a very listenable album and is Imbruglia 's best yet . <sssss> She co-wrote each track here and never call her one-hit wonder .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00005QW3E	5	I 'll admit that I was one of Natalie 's detractors when " Torn " was played into the ground a few years ago . <sssss> I was about to write her off as a one-hit wonder but that all changed when I heard the first single off her new album " White Lilies Island " , called " Wrong Impression " . <sssss> The song itself is even catchier than " Torn " , a song I once loved but grew tired of . <sssss> When I heard the entire album I was definitely a changed person . <sssss> This album has definitely altered my perception and attitude towards Natalie . <sssss> I absolutely adore this album . <sssss> Every song on this album just impressed me so much that I have completely forgiven Natalie for " Torn " . <sssss> " Everything Goes " is a perhaps my favorite ballad on this album . <sssss> It 's quiet , subdued , and emotional . <sssss> The opening riffs to " Hurricane " definitely has some Garbage influences in the first few seconds , as does the following track " Sunlight " . <sssss> Apparently Natalie has been listening to a lot of Garbage and maybe Joydrop with that same electronic / rock vibe . <sssss> " That Day " and " Beauty on Fire " is an excellent way to open up the album . <sssss> There were even moments when Natalie 's vocals sounded a bit like Ani Difranco . <sssss> " Goodbye " is a stunning ballad that is just as good as " Everything Goes " . <sssss> None of the tracks on this album sounds anything like " Torn " which is a good thing . <sssss> My only flaw with this album is that I ca n't play it on my computer at work which really annoys me to no ends of the earth ( thank you very much RCA Records ) . <sssss> Nevertheless I love this album . <sssss> I 'm not going to give it up just because I ca n't listen to it on my computer at work .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00005QW3E	3	Natalie Imbruglia is back 4 years later with " White Lilies Island " . <sssss> , and as the Billboard charts say - they are NOT taking notice . <sssss> With her first single " Wrong Impression " stuck in the high 60s on the Hot 100 , and her album debuting at a dismal and disappointing No . <sssss> 35 , the remainder of Imbruglias fan base are not ecstatic about her sophomore effort . <sssss> In my opinion " White Lilies Island " is a good album , not great . <sssss> The first single " Wrong Impression " is a cute pop song with orchestra interludes showing off Imbruglias voice showing that " Torn " could possibly not be her only hit . <sssss> The production is top rate on this CD , however the album goes in and out with good songs and filler . <sssss> The standouts are " Wrong Impression " , " That Day " , " Hurricane " and " Satellite " . <sssss> This CD is a lot moodier then her previous going up and going down , and is not consistent in any theme . <sssss> Imbruglias second effort is good but its not going to make any waves in the music business . <sssss> , and debuting at No . <sssss> 35 on the album chart this album is going to disappear fast . <sssss> I just wish Imbruglia will take her talent and find better producers to make her a top notch album in the future which could sky rocket her success . <sssss> The other problem , these days in the business you have to release your second album quickly not in 4 years , or the public will forget about you .... . <sssss> remember Lauryn Hill anyone ?
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B00005QW3E	5	I really like this album . <sssss> It 's hard to explain , but just everything about it is so excellent and enjoyable to me . <sssss> She co-wrote all of the 12 songs on the disc . <sssss> It gets off to a good start with the frantic and somewhat neurotic " That Day " . <sssss> A nice egdy song . <sssss> " Wrong Impression " is very memorable and catchy , a nice hit . <sssss> Her songwriting definately has substance and meaning , she has an emotional connection to the music . <sssss> I quite like " Beauty on the Fire " which may be my favorite song on the disc . <sssss> " Satellite " and " Do You Love " are also fabulous . <sssss> " Sunlight " is another excellent edgy song that soars . <sssss> " Goodbye " and " Butterflies " are excellent ballads . <sssss> I ca n't say enough about this album , but it blew me away , and it still does !
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00005QW3E	5	Most artists suffer trying to decide how to follow up a successful debut album . <sssss> How does someone like Natalie Imbruglia acheive this , especially since her debut LEFT OF THE MIDDLE was so popular and dominated the charts ? <sssss> Well folks she did it , and here is WHITE LILIES ISLAND . <sssss> There is something for all her fans on this one , many songs somewhat mirror ones from her debut . <sssss> My favorite track personally is " Goodbye " , she sounds so resonante and beautiful on this track . <sssss> The album is much more in depth in terms of emotional turbulence , she goes deeper , its a moodier album than LEFT OF THE MIDDLE . <sssss> Lyrically , there is growth on this album , even with the numerous producers and collaborations in writing . <sssss> The closing " Come September " is a truly beautiful song with so much rich meaning within its lyrics . <sssss> " That Day " has an interesting mix of dark and emotional delivery from Natalie . <sssss> Highlights include " Beauty on the Fire " , " Butterflies " , " Wrong Impression " , " Goodbye " , " Come September " , and more . <sssss> Overall I think its a step in the right direction , overflowing with quality and talent , there is progression here , if you loved the first you will love this one as well .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B00005QW3E	5	I 've only recently discovered this lost treasure ; I , of course , remember " Torn " , which was a fine song for a time . <sssss> However , when " Wrong Impression " fell on deaf ears , Imbruglia just disappeared off the musical map . <sssss> I just happened to catch this little beauty on sell at the local music store and decided to give it a world : GREAT RESULTS !!!! <sssss> From track 1 the listener is swept away into a magic world of love , fear , and pain . <sssss> The powerful and unforgettable " Beauty on the Fire " will leave you breathless and wondering if this is the same Australian soap-star that swept in and out like a leaf years ago . <sssss> Her singing is so much better !! <sssss> Then comes " Satellite " a PERFECTLY adorable song , and is both catchy and fun , which is great for such an unlikely metaphor . <sssss> On to " Butterflies " and " Wrong Impression " , which now sounds great when taken in the context of the album , and Butterflies is dark and sweet at the same time PERFECT . <sssss> The last track " Come September " is just beautiful THE END . <sssss> Great Songs , Perfect Songwriting mostly by Imbruglia herself . <sssss> Get it NOW !!!! <sssss> This lost beauty is worth the chance .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B00005QW3E	5	I was a bit sceptical when Australian soap star Natalie Imbruglia decided to make a career detour into music . <sssss> Her brilliant debut ` Left of the middle ' however put paid to my fears , my favourites on it being ` Pigeons and crumbs ' , and ` Smoke ' , gentle smouldering acoustic pop songs with electronic flourishes . <sssss> Her second release ` White lilies island ' follows the path set by those 2 tracks . <sssss> With the exception of the jangly upbeat UK hit ` Wrong impression ' ( the closest to the sound on most of her debut ) and the sunny , upbeat ` Sunlight ' ( filled with edgy guitars and electronic flourishes ) , the tracks are more mellow but still edgy and melodic . <sssss> One of my favourites is the delicate ` Do you love ' with ethereal backing vocals , gentle guitars , angelic sounding strings , and Natalie 's crystal clear vocals floating across . <sssss> ` Talk in tongues ' is a stunning acoustic guitar laden song with some distorted sounding guitar and vocals in parts . <sssss> Gentle and haunting . <sssss> In a similar vein is the brilliant ` Beauty on the fire ' . <sssss> The pair are also among my favourites on this great CD . <sssss> Strings and acoustic guitars comprise the gentle ` Butterflies ' . <sssss> The tender brooding ` Hurricane ' belies its name . <sssss> The midtempo ` Satellite ' with its jangly guitars and ` to to doos ' is wickedly catchy . <sssss> ` That day ' is an upbeat song with a waltzing feel , edgy guitars and a rapid fire vocal delivery . <sssss> A much more impressive collection than her debut , showing her impressive growth as an artist . <sssss> I 'm surprised this CD did n't do much better than it did but hey , that 's the music biz for you . <sssss> Do n't let that deter you from unearthing this unappreciated gem .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00005QW3E	3	Natalie 's sophomore album was no slump in an artistic way . <sssss> It 's understandable that music has move to a more pop friendly arena , by the time Natalie 's second effort came to life . <sssss> But I can not get how can a superb single like THAT DAY got overlooked , the melancolic state and the outstanding performance of miss Imbruglia in the track is just delicious . <sssss> WRONG IMPRESSION , okay here 's where the problem began . <sssss> How do you spect people in the US to like a clon of her classic TORN , it is a total marketing mess to try to promote Torn Pt . <sssss> II as the first single of a more mature soft rock album . <sssss> Do n't get me wrong , this tune is fine but not her best joint in the LP . <sssss> BEAUTY ON FIRE her last international single , is more mature and hot rock track . <sssss> Summing all up , WHITE LILIES ISLAND is a more mature and clever delivery from beautiful childish voice Natalie , it is sad that radio or label failed to promoted well .

A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B00005S7UE	5	It was only in late 1998 when Mariah 's # 1 's album was released and two non-compilation albums , RAINBOW and the GLITTER soundtrack following it . <sssss> Here are Mariah 's 28 greatest hits on the Columbia Records label . <sssss> Columbia took Mariah back after being dropped from Virgin . <sssss> All songs have been previously released on Mariah 's earlier albums except ENDLESS LOVE with Luther Vandross and a remix of ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU with Jermaine Dupri and Lil Bow Wow . <sssss> ENDLESS LOVE was written by Lionel Richie which he had recorded with Diana Ross for the 1981 movie of the same name . <sssss> Mariah 's and Luther 's cover appears on Luther 's DUETS album , released in 1994 . <sssss> That same year , Mariah released her MERRY CHRISTMAS album where ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS comes from . <sssss> The MERRY CHRISTMAS version has the Christmas sound in it . <sssss> Lil Bow Bow said at the beginning of the song , " There ai n't do damn Santa Claus " ! <sssss> His mother yells , " Excuse me " ? <sssss> The introduction is an excerpt from the traditional classic JINGLE BELLS .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00005S7UE	5	While never accused of being a particularly meaningful song interpreter , Mariah Carey has nonethelesss produced some of the best pop of the last decade , the majority of which is presented here in this very generous twenty-eight song compilation . <sssss> While her career is seemingly going even further south thanks to her unjustly criticized GLITTER album ( and the accompanying flop of a movie ) , this is a good reminder of why , at her peak , few could come close to Carey 's track record . <sssss> While she was constantly prone to adult contemporary sap ( ' I Do n't Wan na Cry ' , the horrifically maudlin ' My All ' -- one of her worst records ever ) , she also produced a number of first-rate singles ( ' Vision Of Love ' , ' Fantasy ' , 'Em otions ' ) . <sssss> Sixteen of the tracks are carry-overs from her previous 1 'S collection ( rendering that set pointless ) , along with tracks from RAINBOW , as well as a completely unnecessary remix of her holiday track ' All I Want For Christmas Is You ' . <sssss> Additionally , the set includes several of Carey 's non-commercial singles ( the sterling ' Forever ' , ' Butterfly ' ) , as well as one of her best , most fully realized songs ever ( ' Underneath the Stars ' , which was inexplicably never released ) . <sssss> One minor omission her is that of ' Breakdown ' , one of the few highlights from her otherwise dreary BUTTERFLY album . <sssss> Otherwise , this is a great way to filter through the cream of Carey 's Sony years .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00005S7UE	4	It might seem odd to some that this compilation was released , especially since her first compilation of hits , # 1 's , was released in late 1998 , only three years prior to the release of this one . <sssss> GREATEST HITS includes all of those # 1 hits from the album # 1 's , but as well songs that did not peak as high . <sssss> It 's a pretty comprehensive collection of hits of her career with Columbia Records , from her 1990 debut MARIAH CAREY up to her 1999 album RAINBOW . <sssss> It 's nice to have songs like " Butterfly " , " Underneath The Stars " , " Anytime You Need A Friend " and others included , since they are just as good as gold as her # 1 hits as well . <sssss> New fans will enjoy this collection , it 's a good place to start , and avid Carey fans will want to invest in this one as well !
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00005S7UE	3	Mariah Carey bombed and debuted on Billboards Hot 200 album with her 2 CD disc set at an embarrasing No . <sssss> 56 , mustering up a pawltry 30 , 000 units for the first week . <sssss> This shows that Carey especially for her first Greatest Hits set that her star is dimming . <sssss> ( ... ) Mariah Carey had some very good songs in her early career with " Vision of Love " , " Someday " , " Hero " , " Make It Happen " , but as you go on in her career you see her music getting worse with " Fantasy " which is a rip-off of Tom Tom Clubs " Genius of Love " , " Heartbreaker " which is a rip-off of " Fantasy " , " Honey " which started the whole " Fantasy-Heartbreaker " mess and the excruciating ballad with lets see if I can get some fans by singing with 98 Degrees " Thank God I Found You " . <sssss> What is funny that her latest installment on the charts from her disasterous movie career and soundtrack " Glitter " the single " Loverboy " is not included in this set , probably because " Glitter " still has not been certified gold and has only sold 442 , 000 copies to date - the label probably thinks that the Carey fans will buy " Glitter " for " Loverboy " otherwise known as Cameos " Candy " with " Fantasy " and " Heartbreaker " and " Honey " as the melody in this non-hookable song . <sssss> But even " Loverboy " was ignored by fans . <sssss> ( ... ) . <sssss> For Careys earlier efforts CD 1 she gets 5 stars , 1 star for CD 2 with the exception of her Christmas remix song that pushes it up to 2 averaging this Greatest Hits collection to 3 stars . <sssss> Unfortunately I do n't have much respect for Carey in her music career anymore , singing with the likes of Snoop Dogg , or any other rapper just to try to chart higher . <sssss> An artist should focus on their art and put out music from their heart , obviously in CD 2 it shows with the likes of " Honey " , " Fantasy " , etc . <sssss> she was singing from her bustline . <sssss> ( ... )
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B00005S7UE	4	As a casual fan , for many years I just had her " 1 's " collection and figured it was enough . <sssss> Well recently I got this " Greatest Hits " fairly cheap and quickly realized how much better it really is . <sssss> Besides the inclusion of more tracks , I like this collection more for the songs that did n't reach the top of the charts . <sssss> Some of the minor hits I like alot more than the # 1 hits , specifically " Ca n't Let Go " , " Make It Happen " , and the cover of " Without You " . <sssss> I think my current favorite here is " Anytime You Need A Friend " . <sssss> That song is excellent , and is one of a few I had completely forgotten about . <sssss> Another plus to this set is the inclusion of the songs from " Rainbow " . <sssss> In a perfect world this would also have " Breakdown " and " Against All Odds " , but it 's still an amazing package . <sssss> The only other surprise to me was the lack of pictures . <sssss> She usually gives us some nice shots , but not here .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00005S7UE	5	Mariah Carey 's GREATEST HITS , covers her 10 year plus career quite well , offering fans 28 different songs throughout that period . <sssss> It does echo of her past compilation from 1998 # 1 's , all of the songs found their way here too ( with the exception of Whenever You Call with Brian McKnight ) . <sssss> Some of the songs on this collection were never released commercially in the US , or just were not hits at all , but they are still good songs . <sssss> For example , Butterfly , Breakdown , Underneath The Stars , etc were all released outside of the US , but never commercially here . <sssss> Mariah has had an impressive career with a slew of # 1 hits , but its not only the # 1 hits that are good , but these other songs that were sorely missed on radio . <sssss> Nevertheless this is a nice retrospective of a career , and its a must have for fans and new fans alike .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00005S7UE	3	I think Mariah has a Good Voice & Talent but easily forgettable Music . <sssss> for all Her Success & things Her Material is easily forgotten within a Year of it 's release . <sssss> She is Very Prolific but also Very Predictable as a Artist . <sssss> for many Years Her first Single always reminded you of someone or a Song you have heard before & things are still in tact with that here . <sssss> Her Voice gets Her over on alot of Hit & alot of Miss Material here . <sssss> I think She has something Better down the Road if only She challenges Herself but this best Represents Her . <sssss> we shall see .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00005S7UE	1	This is truly for people who do n't own Mariah 's albums or the # 1 's collection , this album does not include nothing new , nor even edit versions , remixes of the hits , only a lame version of the xmas joint " All I Want for Xmas is You " , the only good thing is that they included all the singles cover photos , but after that , you can find all this versions on their original albums releases , wich is more worth it !
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00005S7UE	3	In a mere 3 years following her # 1 's compilation , Sony releases this double CD of all of Mariah 's hits , as well as a handful of album tracks . <sssss> The tracklisting is decent , but I would love to have seen " Breakdown " , " The Roof " , or " Never Forget You " . <sssss> The strongest cuts here are " I Do n't Wan na Cry " , " Make it Happen " , " Emotions " , and " Honey " . <sssss> Everything else ranges from the bland ( " Hero " ) to the unlistenable ( " One Sweet Day " ) . <sssss> This compilation shows why Mariah is one of the most frustrating singers around : she 's got a great voice , but her choice of material is usually questionable . <sssss> Dump the gooey ballads by Walter Afanseneiff , and she 'll do fine . <sssss> If you 're a Mariah fan or a casual listener , this is the only CD you will need . <sssss> One final note : the packaging of this hits collection is shameful . <sssss> There are no lyrics , no commentary , no summary of her recording career . <sssss> You 'd think that Sony would put a little more love into the pacakging of this double-CD set , but I suppose that 's not the case , here .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B00005S7UE	5	... . <sssss> in addition to my purchase of this great CD , I hope the Un-Diva would indulge a fan when he sends her a blank cassette tape and a page torn from his telephone book . <sssss> It will help me fill my MC Jones , see , because I , one among millions of her fans , will probably love her stylings on the names -- like I said before , she can make the names of the telephone book sound great . <sssss> If you do n't love " Hero " and " I Still Believe " , then I do n't know what to tellya ... but to sing with that voice and to be so beautiful , too ? <sssss> What a Star !
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00005TPKC	5	Under rug swept is by far Alanis Morissette 's best album to date . <sssss> I love all her albums but this particular album is in a league all its own . <sssss> 21 things i want in a lover is awesome and fun : " Are you uninhibited in bed more than three times a week , up for being experimental " ? <sssss> Naricuss is so honest and true about men and their actions : " You go back to being so oblivious , you go back to the center of the universe " . <sssss> Hands Clean is a classic , about an inappropriate relationship : " I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and i think i like it " . <sssss> Flinch is raw and i guess about an ex-boyfiend : " What are you my blood , you touch me like you are my blood ... " So Unsexy struck a cord with me , about insecuirties : " Your hand pulling away and I 'm devasted " . <sssss> Precious Illusions is my fave song about learning to let go of your self-destructive imagination : " This pill will help me yet as will these boys gone through like water " ? <sssss> At that particular time about Alanis 's break-up with her boyfreind : " And I wanted to save us from high water or hell and i kept on ignoring the ambivulance you felt ... " A Man well not sure what this song is about but it 's interesting : " I am a man who has grown from a son ... " You owe me nothing in return has the best bridge part I 've ever heard in a song : " I bet you 're wondering when the next payback shoe will eventually drop " . <sssss> Surrendering the best song on the album , it 's about trusting someone again and loving unconditionally : " You hid away from much through humor , your choice of armor was your intellect ... " and the closing song Utopia is just a lovely and gentle song about the discovery of human acceptance : " We 'd hold close and let go and know when to do which " . <sssss> Under rug swept is the best Alanis record , also check out her other albums .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00005TPKC	2	Alanis Morrisette 's third studio effort opens with her essaying to us the twenty one things she wants from a lover -- another in a long line of " overshares " this once compelling artist foists on her seemingly adoring fans . <sssss> As with her sophomore effort , only to a greater degree , Morrisette manages to bog down her potent melodies with cluttered , New Age garble -- it 's criminal that she has such a way with a hook , considering that she continues to betray her own best efforts with her overly verbose , undisciplined style of songwriting . <sssss> Tracks such as ' Hands Clean ' and ' Surrendering ' chug along with terrific urgency -- until you attempt to listen to the lyrics . <sssss> In fact , about two minutes into each track , you 'll be scratching your head wondering " When is THIS song going to end " ? <sssss> It makes one long for the days when this screaming banshee was singing about going " down " on her lover in a theater . <sssss> Do yourself a favor , sweep this under the rug -- and leave it there .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B00005TPKC	3	Alanis has changed so much geeez ! <sssss> This album delivers kind of , its no " JLP " it may be better than " SFIJ " but its not an amazing album she has just quietened down and taken things slow . <sssss> She released one big single ( " Hands Clean " ) and another not-so-big ( " Precious Illusions " ) but this time its not great its just -- average , die hard alanis fans will not agree but its not her best maybe her worst - but maybe not its just sitting there in the middle , Essential Tracks " Hands Clean " , " 21 Things Lover " , " Utopia " and " Narcissus " This is ok .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00005TPKC	5	If you have n't noticed , " Under Rug Swept " is not produced by Glen Ballard ( as were her last two albums ) but is produced by no one other than herself . <sssss> In my opinion she 's done a fabulous , if not better job without his direction . <sssss> She 's come a long way since the widely successful " Jagged Little Pill " and the supposed founder-of-oneself on " Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie " , but it is n't until you hear " Under Rug Swept " that you feel just how happy she truly is . <sssss> That 's why it 's so sad to find a lot of die-hard " Jagged Little Pill " fans becoming more and more disappointed with each new release . <sssss> The good thing , however , is how all of her " true fans " are growing with her and loving every step of it . <sssss> She just seems so comfortable and confident with this album , which I believe to be the goal she was striving for . <sssss> Much like her last album she experiments with different sounds but here she broadens everything , taking it the extra mile . <sssss> She even has Flea of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers play bass on the second song " Narcissus " . <sssss> It 's " Hands Clean " ( her first single ) , however , that captures the listener , only getting better as it moves along . <sssss> Her apparent secong single " So Unsexy " is the next notable highlight but my favorites have got to be the aggressive guitar filled " A Man " , the new-agey piano-induced " You Owe Me Nothing In Return " ( which is my absolute favorite ! <sssss> ) , and the powerful " Utopia " which is sang with passionate grace . <sssss> Another bonus to this CD is the secret website which includes : Utopia Lyrics , a letter from Alanis , the Making of Hands Clean , Exclusive audio tracks such as Flinch ( live at the Whisky in LA ) and a brand new song ( which I believe will be changing periodically on the website ) called Sister Bliss ...
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00005TPKC	3	Alanis repeats the same mistake each time an album others is out . <sssss> She tries to say too much in too little time . <sssss> On her last effort , 17 songs had thousands of words , but it 's ok then cos some of the songs were really amazing and feature a more matured production , featuring a diverse Indian sound , electronica , and dance / rock . <sssss> On Under Rug Swept , the decision to release Hands Clean as the first single still goes to show how much she intends to reach the masses with a rather radio-friendly track . <sssss> Elsewhere on the album , 21 Things might sound like a nice edgy guitar-rock track , reminiscent of her Pill days . <sssss> On Narcissus , Alanis works her voice into a melancholic winner and brings out the emotional depth in the song . <sssss> The danger of Alanis goin with it alone is that she oftens get into a self-obsessed mode where she waxes lyrical but often ends up deep within herself that alienates her listners . <sssss> What 's she trying to tell us ? <sssss> By the time you get through with Alanis , you 'll be as vexed as our rock princess . <sssss> the best track here must be the concluding track Upotia , that features a strip-down , nearer to acoustic sound . <sssss> On this album , Alanis does score by not over-using her voice to a screech . <sssss> Not a terribly fabulous album but nonetheless true to its roots . <sssss> Not likely a 15 million seller but will just do well . <sssss> Overall , a controlled delivery as always but too many things to say in too little time .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00005TPKC	5	With UNDER RUG SWEPT , Alanis returns with her newest studio album since 1998 's SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE . <sssss> The 11 tracks here are excellent songs . <sssss> Start with the lead off single , " Hands Clean " , a song about an affair with an older man and keeping it a secret , its just a great song that stays in your head . <sssss> The opening track " 21 Things I Want In A Lover " is an edgy rock song where Alanis lists the things she looks for in a lover , not neccesarily needs but qualities that she prefers . <sssss> " Surrendering " is just so honest and beautiful at the same time . <sssss> " Precious Illusions " is another winner , its a must single its very good . <sssss> The album ends with " Utopia " , a song about the ideal world she is seeking to find . <sssss> Other highlights include " Flinch " , " So Unsexy " and " That Particular Moment " . <sssss> Overall its a winner and well worth checking out !
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00005TPKC	4	Alanis is back with her third effort " Under Rug Swept " . <sssss> , and what a good album it is . <sssss> Alanis has shown so much growth over the years , and with her first single " Hands Clean " which is a more upbeat , more positive approach in her music about the ups and downs of career life in relationships , friendships , jobs , etc . <sssss> The rest of the CD is also very strong with " So Unsexy " , " 21 Things I Want In A Lover " , " Flinch " to name a few . <sssss> Alanis dropped her co-writer / producer Glen Ballard and has simply gone on her own showing that Alanis has all the talent it takes to do a great piece of work . <sssss> " Under Rug Swept " is equally good as " Jagged Little Pill " and definitely better than her second effort " Supposed Former Infatuation Junky " . <sssss> However I give Alanis 4 stars instead of 5 due to her constant reminding of how men are the sorry creatures of the planet , and her lyrics sometime tend to go on the weak side . <sssss> However Alanis is great when it comes to the melody and hook side which all her songs are very strong in . <sssss> Still a great album , ... and being only 28 , Alanis has a lot of growth with her life experiences to continue to make her songs lyrically stronger .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B00005TPKC	4	Alanis ' 2002 album UNDER RUG SWEPT is a good album , for the most part . <sssss> She only falters on the songs " So Unsexy " , " That Particular Time " , and " Precious Illusions " . <sssss> Otherwise its a seamless album , filled with great songs . <sssss> It opens with the rockin " 21 Things I Want In A Lover " , and into the sarcastically funny " Narcissus " . <sssss> " Hands Clean " was the first single , a nice song reflecting on a May / December romance . <sssss> " Flinch " is an absolutely brilliant acoustic song , a definite highlight on the set . <sssss> " You Owe Me Nothing in Return " is my personal favorite on the album . <sssss> " A Man " and " Surrendering " are also highlights from the set , just great songs . <sssss> She closes with " Utopia " , an idealistic song about the perfect society . <sssss> I think it 's a good follow up to her 1998 album SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE , which was art in itself , so to follow it up is pretty hard . <sssss> UNDER RUG SWEPT is a solid album for the most part though .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B00005TPKC	4	Alanis Morissette gets into the carpet where most generic brands of vacuum do not . <sssss> " Under Rug Swept " is the third testament to Morissette 's capable songwriting abilities . <sssss> Look between the fibers of " Flinch " and " Hands Clean " ( according to Morissette it 's told from the other person 's point of view , which few songwriter 's even think about trying ) . <sssss> While the penmanship is poignant , the music fails to capture the immediacy of 1995 's " Jagged Little Pill " . <sssss> This is , after all , Morissette 's third cd for a major label , and have n't we been here before ? <sssss> The musical riffs fit like a well trodden carpet , and it could be said that musical experimentation is n't one of Alanis 's strong points . <sssss> Yet , the music here is entertaining like the old fashioned chorus of " Narcissus " or the trance beats of " Surrendering " . <sssss> The one thing fans will take with them is Morissette 's heartfelt lyrics . <sssss> This is the grit in the carpet that will continue to draw crowds . <sssss> Few musicians covet their shag carpeting , often choosing stain resistant approaches to music and lyrics . <sssss> " Under Rug Swept " is as durable as an old shag alright , right down to the 70 's - looking cd cover . <sssss> Perhaps Morissette might consider working with a Peter Gabriel or fellow Canadian Robbie Robertson next time out . <sssss> It might give new musical direction and keep fans glued to the floor . <sssss> Overall , no fleas from Morissette this time out , this one 's a keeper .
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B00005TPKC	1	I just do n't know what it is but I 've never liked Alanis Morrisette ! <sssss> With the exception of " Ironic " - with it 's sunny soft-rock melody and catchy chrous-I have not had that much love for Alanis 's music ( in fact , I still find the fact that some 14million Americans own " Jagged Little Pill " - his 1995 debut verysuprising ) . <sssss> I tried to give Alanis another chance though . <sssss> BY checking out her third studio album , " Under Rug Swept " . <sssss> But ... again , I just did n'twell , dig , it. <sssss> I found the songs soggy and 1995-sounding . <sssss> Unlike some of her peersher music is just not that appealing to me . <sssss> And I usually like the type of music that Alanis ' music would be " catergorized " as but I 'm sorry , it 's just not that great ! <sssss> " Hands Clean " : A " Jagged Little Pill " outake ? <sssss> No ? <sssss> My point exactly . <sssss> I do give her credict though because she wrote and produced the album herself ( instead of with veteran pop masteroGlen Ballard-who produced her last two multiplatinum efforts-whose worked with amongst many others Micheal Jackson , Wilson Phillips , Paula Abdul , No Doubt , and most recently Dave Matthews Band ) . <sssss> BUT I 'm sorry , this music is a bit sour . <sssss> I know that I 'm going to tick Alanis fans off and they going to give this review as many ' not-helpful ' votes as possible but I just had to put my two cents in ... . <sssss> hope you understand .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00005TPKC	5	Its been a long 3 years since Alanis last graced us with her underrated project SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE , and what can we say ? <sssss> After listening to UNDER RUG SWEPT , I can honestly say it was worth the wait . <sssss> The album opens with a hard rock type song in " 21 Things I Want In A Lover " , where Alanis lists what she describes as qualities , not neccesarily needs , that she wants in a lover . <sssss> A surefire hit if released as a single I think . <sssss> Everyone knows the opening single " Hands Clean " , which is a great song to introduce the public to the album with . <sssss> " So Unsexy " is another great song , which rightfully deserves to be a single . <sssss> Other highlights include the songs " Surrendering " , " Utopia " , " Flinch " , and " A Man " . <sssss> This is definately one of her best albums , and worth a listen or two . <sssss> You can listen from start to finish without skipping any tracks , that right there tells you this is a good cd . <sssss> So get UNDER RUG SWEPT , and enjoy the music !
A5889INEGKCQY	B00005TPKC	2	I really really liked Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Infuaktion Junkie was even better in my opinion . <sssss> I was excited when this cd came out and thought it would be great . <sssss> I was wrong . <sssss> The fact is that it took her more than 3 years to release this shows us perhaps Alanid should try out other things then making albums . <sssss> She get rids of Glen Ballard and writes and produced the album on her own which of course nothing wrong with that . <sssss> But it shows she is new at this when listening to the album . <sssss> The album lacks in brilliant hooks and good melodies and lyrically it is far from being amazing . <sssss> She obviously has nothing more to say and repeats what she was singing about on her previous LP 's which was slef - discovery and her bad luck with Men . <sssss> This album is about finding men and love and it makes you think after listening to this album perhaps Alanis may have been a bit unfair to the guy she sang You Oughta Know about . <sssss> When I come to think about it she is not a girl that I would like to date . <sssss> Nice try Alanis but better luck next time . <sssss> Hey was n't she supposed to release two albums in 2002 but only released one . <sssss> What happened to the other one Alanis . <sssss> Anyway a total disapointmentn and lets hope that Alanis gives us something to talk about next time .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00005TPKC	5	Four years after her last studio effort , Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette comes back full fledge with " Under Rug Swept " . <sssss> In short , I loved the album : lyrics pick up on some of her earlier material ( Jagged Little Pill ) , but musically she 's diversified in several new and interesting directions . <sssss> Overall , the album is both , powerful and beautiful . <sssss> Starting with a " 21 things I want in a love " full of force , it goes on to do some of Alanis ' most beautiful works with " Flinch " , " So Unsexy " and " You owe me nothing in return " , all of which are bound to become great hits , I 'm sure . <sssss> Complementing them , the more intimate " Utopia " , " That peculiar time " and " Hands Clean " . <sssss> Get it , you 'll love it . <sssss> I predict it will be one of the ten best albums released this year .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00005TPKC	2	Alanis Morissette is Arguably one of the Most Over-Hyped Acts over the Past Decade easily . <sssss> when She first Arrived in Her Post Disco / Pop Era She seemed like something different . <sssss> " You Outta Know " was a catchy but in your face song . <sssss> since then with & without Glenn Ballard She has came close to that Intensity & Almost matched it with various songs but this Album shows Why She still has n't Surpased those Heights . <sssss> She matches the Production but the songs themselves seem to Formula Driven to me . <sssss> they are missing Drive & Depth . <sssss> Vocally & Lyrically not much has changed . <sssss> She can take a few years off if She keeps the Formula going . <sssss> it 's cool She has Label Mate or I should I Say Former Label Mate MeShall ' Nede'ocello on it. <sssss> it 's cool to see Her still doing Her thing but this Album is another Easy Cash in overall .
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00005TPKC	2	I was looking forward to this album for a long time . <sssss> Ever since it was announced in the summer , i believe . <sssss> She had promised she would return to the sounds of Jagged Little Pill , so i expected some angst . <sssss> And while i 'm glad that she 's happy , i just cant see her in that same light . <sssss> She 's simply better at making angry songs . <sssss> And this CD sounds very happy , and a little more poppy than her other albums . <sssss> I dont know if its just me , but all bands seem to be getting more poppy on later releases . <sssss> THis includes No Doubt , the Cranberries , and many others ... <sssss> There are few that would even be indecisable enough to get played on the radio , and the first song is the hardest song on the album which is quite disappointing . <sssss> I hope you are happy alanis in the path you have chosen to quick fame and a quick comeback by creating radio friendly songs .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B00005TPKC	5	This is a very good CD . <sssss> Alanis sounds great on most of these tracks . <sssss> I almost forgot the lyrics when listening to it at first . <sssss> The first single Hands Clean sounds really good . <sssss> It is a song about the violation of a minor . <sssss> Hands Clean is also about trying to get on with one 's life after that . <sssss> I loved the song 21 things I want in a Lover . <sssss> It is a very brash and honest tune that reminds me of the song You Oughta Know . <sssss> It makes me rethink of the qualities I seek in a lover . <sssss> So Unsexy is a great ballad about how we can allow a person to make us feel so unsexy and insignificant . <sssss> At that particular time is a good song about the different stages in a relationship . <sssss> It is a song that reminds us that we need to take time out to evaluate the direction of our relationships . <sssss> Under Rug Swept is the best CD of 2002 so far .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00005TPKC	4	This third delivery by Morissette was a relief too the overcrowed " Supposed " ... this album is more down to earth and more free of pressure , produced by herself . <sssss> The leading single " Hands Clean " although not the best of the album is very catchy and with very truthful lyrics , a well deserved return to the mainstream , the second and last single " Precious Illutions " it 's a master piece of rock , good chorus line , good meaningful lyrics , great vocal arragement and stunning music , an A + , other tracks that stand as best " Surrounding " should have been single tune , great beginning and voice , " So Unsexy " haha great tune , " Utopia " sounds so intimate ... this is a great third record sad that none of the other tracks got the attention to be out there available as radio airplay tracks , guess Britney did n't gave space to Alanis back 2001 .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B00005YW4H	3	Do n't take a 3 star rating for this album as an insult . <sssss> It 's a nice CD . <sssss> Very relaxing and sweet , but it 's just not as great as it has been made out to be . <sssss> This album pretty much swept the Grammys and has probably been the biggest selling album of the last year . <sssss> It 's still in the top 20 on the album charts and has been out for going on 80 weeks . <sssss> Quite an acheivement . <sssss> The problem is , many of the songs on here run into one another . <sssss> There are a handful of distinguishable tracks , but the rest sound to similar . <sssss> Of course , " Do n't Know Why " is an undoubtable keeper and the song that gathered attention to Norah Jones . <sssss> It 's beautiful in every aspect . <sssss> " Come Away With Me " is my favorite track . <sssss> Just listen and let your imagination go free . <sssss> " Turn Me On " is a highlight as is " One Flight Down " . <sssss> I recommend this album as a relaxation CD . <sssss> I would not listen to it while driving . <sssss> It might very well put you to sleep . <sssss> If you 're not into slow music , then steer clear of this . <sssss> Odds are , you wo n't enjoy it . <sssss> If you do like slow music , give it a try .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00005YW4H	5	Listening to this album puts me in a trance . <sssss> How many music collections can actually do this ? <sssss> Not many , that 's for sure . <sssss> A truly rare treat ! <sssss> A beautiful , young woman with a voice that is beautifully textured and magnificent . <sssss> Norah Jones should win the Best New Artist Grammy , and the awards should n't stop there . <sssss> I 'm a loyal Canadian , and I support Avril Lavigne as a fellow Canadian . <sssss> But , I must say " Sorry Avril " ! <sssss> You 've got nothing on Norah Jones . <sssss> A throw back to the glory days of Billie Holliday and Etta James , Norah , 23 , has the poise and maturity of an artist twice her age . <sssss> Powerful , expressive , and passionate , each song on this debut album is a work of art . <sssss> ' Come away with me ' is a gorgeous original ballad that sounds like it could be a Billie Holliday classic . <sssss> ' Cold , Cold Heart ' is covered beautifully ( Hank Williams would be proud ) , and ' Painter 's Song ' is haunting to the bone . <sssss> Her approach is layed back , gentle , but still powerful and emotional . <sssss> I do n't for a second regret buying this album , and neither should anyone else . <sssss> Norah is a rare talent that comes along once in a blue moon . <sssss> And for such incredible , classy music to come from someone so young is even more amazing . <sssss> A worth while purchase that will never grow old . <sssss> Timeless !
A2FL41BCS486E8	B00005YW4H	4	I like this cd because when I listen to it the music relaxes me . <sssss> It puts you in a mellow mood . <sssss> My favorite tracks are : Come Away With Me , Turn Me On , Shoot the Moon , and The Long Day is Over . <sssss> The others are good , but this ones really stand out to me . <sssss> Norah 's voice is really great . <sssss> She never oversings or screams in the songs , If you want music that is soothing , but this cd .
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B00005YW4H	4	Here you have it : the album that swept the competition at Grammy show in February 2003 . <sssss> In case you still do not know what Norah Jones is all about ... <sssss> Hype is an interesting thing . <sssss> Sometimes publicity inexplicably sits on an artist you would never think to be the one . <sssss> However , it happened to Norah Jones and -- well , she largely deserves it . <sssss> When you play " Come Away With Me " ( 2002 ) without knowing anything about its successes , it would probably not occur to you how admired it is . <sssss> Its sound is sober , laconic , sparse . <sssss> That 's the deal . <sssss> A Slovak ( my mother tongue ) sayings goes , " In Simplicity Is Beauty " . <sssss> You can apply it here , after a few listens , maybe one will do . <sssss> Being an out-of-wedlock child of a well-known Indian musician Ravi Shankar , Norah apparently got more than her fair share of his musical genes . <sssss> Her music contains elements of jazz , country , folk and blues -- but in fact , " Come Away With Me " is a very quality pop . <sssss> There is nothing groundbreaking here , production of Arif Mardin ( he used to work with Barbra , Aretha and Bette , to name a few ) emphasises the pleasant peacefulness . <sssss> The guest players also need not be ashamed of their performances ( unsung sections on the title track , for instance , are painfully beautiful ) -- but it is Norah 's voice , very mature , that is up in front . <sssss> Among the highlights are the Grammy-awarded opening song " Do n't Know Why " , bluesy " Turn Me On " , beautiful melody of " One Flight Down " and remake of standard " The Nearness Of You " ( although Ella Fitzgerald remains untouchable in her version ) . <sssss> " Come Away With Me " are 45 minutes of pleasant and quality listening . <sssss> Enough ? <sssss> Yes , in times we live in ( and given the music that surrounds us on TV and popular radio ) it 's more than enough .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B00005YW4H	4	Move over Britney , there 's a new chick in town - and this one 's got genuine singing talent !! <sssss> Norah " NJ " Jones is one of the best female artists - and one of the best artists in general - that I 've heard in years , superceding even bands like the Strokes and Gwar . <sssss> To me , it 's basically wonderful how she blends such a mix of styles ; country , folk , pop , rock and everything in between can be heard on this gentle collection of soothing songs . <sssss> Norah would have fit in great at Lillith Fair - if only she would have been a little older back then ! <sssss> IT 'S A REAL PLEASURE TO HEAR !! 
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B00005YW4H	5	I heard another review on this page asking " is this jazz or not " . <sssss> Who cares what it is , it 's a masterpiece . <sssss> Her quiet gentle voice is perfect for the music , and it separates her from many other young artists who sing loud , though many of them are great as well . <sssss> " Do n't Know Why " showcases her talent at her best . <sssss> If you 're looking for music to relax to or to make love with that special someone , throw away Louis Armstrong , Frank Sinatra , Billie Holiday , etc . <sssss> and get Norah Jones . <sssss> I do n't usually listen to music this soft , but Norah is one of the best new female artists ! <sssss> She was well-deserved of all five of her grammys : Best Pop Album , Best Female Pop Performance , Best New Artist , Record of the Year , and ..... . <sssss> Album of the Year . <sssss> This is going to be a classic album in the soon-enough years to come . <sssss> Since , at age 22 , her music is so good , I ca n't wait to hear the album she releases next !
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00005YW4H	4	When a non-mainstream artist makes some kind of impact on the charts , he or she becomes some kind of a focal point . <sssss> At the age of 22 , Norah Jones has exceeded many xpectations of her . <sssss> Come Away With Me serves best at introducing the masses to jazz music . <sssss> While not overly jazzy to alienate mainstream listeners , the singer infuses some form of modernity to the songs and past masterpieces to bring jazz music to a whole new level through her interpretation . <sssss> Jones may not hide her inexperience , her efforts are by no means inadequate . <sssss> Though still far from the likeness of Grammy winner Diana Krall , both Krall and Jones seek to bring the genre into the limelight and gladly , more people can discover the wonders of jazz music .
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B00005YW4H	5	Whether you 're a fan of 112 or D-12 , we all can stand to listen to some music once in a while to just kick back and relax . <sssss> Norah Jones 's album , Come Away with Me , is perfect for that . <sssss> From Blue Note Records , you would expect a strictly jazz album , but in fact , similar to the Blue Break Beats compilations from the same record label , this album contains a mixture of other styles with jazz . <sssss> In fact , there are signs of country , jazz , soft rock and a little blues found here , so you do n't have to worry about hearing the same song over and over again on this album . <sssss> Those who say that some of her songs sound the same are probably the ones who do n't really listen to people like her anyway . <sssss> If you take a good listen to her covers like " Cold Cold Heart " and other songs like the title track she wrote , " Feelin ' the Same Way " , and of course , " Do n't Know Why " , you 'll witness a 22-year-old woman with a variety of styles . <sssss> The album 's best song , " Painter Song " , showcases Norah just riding along with the track . <sssss> She does n't try to hit very high notes or ad-lib her way through a verse . <sssss> This is important in a world where new artists tend to over-prove themselves on their albums . <sssss> I did n't necessarily give this album five stars because it 's classic material . <sssss> I gave it that because none of the songs are bad and you can listen to it straight through , for all of the songs are three minutes or less , leaving an album of around 45 minutes . <sssss> And there 's nothing wrong with that .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00005YW4H	5	Norah Jones is another fine example of in which curiousity killed the cat based on the word of mouth . <sssss> I 'm not particularly keen on anything jazz or jazz-influenced that still did n't deter me from checking out Norah Jones ' stellar debut album " Come Away With Me " . <sssss> " Come With Me " is a stunning collection of original and cover songs in which Norah 's breathtaking voice gracefully glides through without a single stutter . <sssss> Now while this album is n't pure jazz ( according to some people which really should not be an issue ) . <sssss> Norah reminded me quite a bit of the late folk / jazz singer Eva Cassidy with her soft-spoken vocals . <sssss> The only song I did n't particularly cared for on this cd was " Do n't Know Why " . <sssss> That song just did n't do anything for me . <sssss> I loved her version of the Hank Williams ' song " Cold Cold Heart " . <sssss> I thought she did a spectacular job on that song . <sssss> As far as original material , I think my favorite track is " Nightingale " . <sssss> The song simply took my breathe away ( as did the rest of the album ) . <sssss> This is a nice easy-going album to listen to with diverse influences of jazz and folk fused together . <sssss> Hopefully on her next album , Norah will choose a few more songs that are more uptempo but overall " Come Away With Me " did n't disappoint me . <sssss> Norah definitely shows a lot of promise as an artist and I will most certainly be keeping a close eye on her in the near future .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B00005YW4H	4	I 'm not sure if this deserved 8 grammys , or that it should still be a top Amazon seller after almost 2 years out , but it is very good . <sssss> I 'd imagine alot of it 's success came from being one of few releases of it 's kind to get much exposure recently . <sssss> People do want a change from the same generic radio songs , and this is a nice one . <sssss> Each track is nice and easy , piano , acoustic guitar , light drums , and has a jazzy feeling , without really being jazz . <sssss> I really do like her voice too . <sssss> It 's scratchy but smooth , and very sexy . <sssss> So , I 'm not sure if it 's the album of 2002 , but it is 14 cool tracks that sound as good as she looks .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B00005YW4H	5	I like to check every thursday the Billboard 's charting lists and last year I saw in several lists the Norah Jones name but I do n't know , she never called my attention and when I heard the song " come away with me " happened the same thing and I did n't buy the album . <sssss> So this year when I saw the Grammy ceremony I saw as everyone did that she won 5 of them and then I heard the song " I do n't know why " and i decided to buy her cd . <sssss> Played and I found it very good and now I love hearing it while I 'm sending mails or even reading a book . <sssss> It 's so relaxing and Norah 's voice is extraordinary you can hear this cd all day long and you ' lll never get tired .
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B00005YW4H	4	I discovered this lovely young lady and her Blue Note debut , " Come Away With Me " , in February 2002 , just the same week as " Come Away " 's release . <sssss> A nice bluesy yet mellow voice capturing the best of Phoebe Snow and Rickie Lee Jones and a sound that was set to be mellow , jazzy , and sustained . <sssss> After being well impressed on a jazz showcase that February , I purchased her album for under eight dollars and it was a pretty nice album , I must say . <sssss> Not perfect in the least but for what it was , very impressive . <sssss> Although , the music seems to fall asleep at times and Norah 's playing needs more energy , it 's satin-y seduction music . <sssss> Not torchy , just right and mellow . <sssss> One or two detractors would complain back before " Come Away " 's sleeper mainstream success came underway but ever since the album hit # 1 , hit 10 million , won up a storm at the annual Grammys , and made Norah a pop starlet , haters are coming in right and left . <sssss> That 's terrible if you 're just saying you do n't like media because of it 's success . <sssss> It makes sense if the music is n't for you or if you dislike it , that 's called human taste BUT just bad-mouthing it because you 're upset with it 's level of success is called jealousy . <sssss> Do n't get it confused . <sssss> " Come Away " does n't promise to be a classic or Nina Simone ( RIP ) / Ella level vocal music . <sssss> Not at all . <sssss> It 's the first entry to a exquisitely talented young lady 's career . <sssss> Very flawed like most debuts are but in the age of Avril Lavigne and 50 Cent , the fact that mellow loungey pop / jazz-blues hits # 1 is a revelation in the world of chart-pop . <sssss> Stop hating on the child 's success and congratulate . <sssss> ( 3.7 stars )
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B00005YW4H	1	I do n't know what suddenly made Norah Jones the biggest artist of the year and sold millions of copies and won a jackpot of grammies . <sssss> Did people forget about Jazz music ? <sssss> and now suddenly when there are few artists making jazz they decided to go for this . <sssss> So called critics even compared her to Billie Holiday . <sssss> But Norah Jones music is neither Jazz nor comparable to Billie Holiday . <sssss> Sure the album is diffrent from the rest , and that 's perhaps why it was hyped up . <sssss> The music industry needed something diffrent to increase their budgets . <sssss> " Come away with me " is a pretty dull album in general . <sssss> A few decent songs but far from as unique as beeing said in the papers . <sssss> Go find some real jazz albums instead .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00005YW4H	4	Norah Jones ' biggest accomplishment resides in her ability to blend musical styles in a way that is mindboggling . <sssss> Her songs , depending on " where you come from " might sound as anything ranging from Jazz , to Country to pop . <sssss> The album as a whole has songs that outweigh the over-promoted " Do n't Know Why " and " Come Away with Me " in many ways , such as the closing track , " The Nearness of You " . <sssss> ' Come Away with Me ' ( the album ) conveys the work of a veteran producer ( Arif Mardin , responsible of landmark recordings by Aretha Franklin , Dusty Springfield , Roberta Flack , and Willie Nelson , among others ) with his artist in front of the mic and playing piano , accompanied by a load of talented session musicians , in an effort to establish her as a ruler within a specific segment . <sssss> In trying to do that , they 've succeeded in my book . <sssss> As young an artist as she is , she has many years ahead of her to continue to bring out all her musical talent and background . <sssss> As a side trivia piece , Norah is the daughter of legend Ravi Shankar , the sitar virtuoso who influenced The Beatles , among many other musicians of the 20th and 21st century , so it 's no surprise that she 's got the talent she 's shown so far : it runs in her veins .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00005YW4H	3	having been told of Norah Jones & seeing a On-Line Performance of Her & Charlie Hunter & Group I thought She might have some Juice . <sssss> but after listening to this Album & hearing the Arrangements She is More Closer to Another Alica Keys only with the Blue Note Record Tag . <sssss> Keys got over & has a Real Middle of the Road Vibe & that 's what I felt after Hearing Norah Jones . <sssss> Talent is there but Like Keys The Soul , Warmth & Depth is Missing in Action . <sssss> hopefully with time things will start to Cook . <sssss> this is n't fully it . <sssss> She has something but The Hype ai n't Matched Yet .
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00005YW4H	3	i bought this album jsut because of the hype , and while it lives up to some of it , there are some songs on the album that just sound like fillers . <sssss> dont know why , the radio single is a great song , and there are some other great gems on the album . <sssss> i found the album to be a bit bland , though , and while her voice is unique , its not the strongest ive ever heard . <sssss> the instrmentation throughout the tracks is mediocre at best and doesnt show her piano skills too much . <sssss> if you are just buying the album for the piano playing , skip it . <sssss> plus , she only wrote 2 of the songs on the whole album . <sssss> she shows alot of promise though , and maybe she will get better as time progresses .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B00005YW4H	4	Norah is a paradigm to me in that she is not a great singer , but she is a very entertaining artist . <sssss> To be honest I bought this album not expecting much , however , I was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> Soft , soothing melodies crossed with her cool , husky voice make for an extremely laid-back " Sunday Afternoon " feeling treat that all types of people can enjoy . <sssss> While I enjoyed the jazzy " Do n't Know Why " , the real treat here is the ethereal " Come Away With Me " . <sssss> This title track just sweeps the listener away into a beautiful place ; in fact , when I listen to the song I imagine a setting like something out of " Under the Tuscan Sun " . <sssss> This song alone makes the album worth the buy .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B00005YW4H	5	When I first heard Norah Jones ' " Come Away With Me " , I wrote that this is why music is such a great art , and how you can be amazed by something new . <sssss> The album remains a fave of mine , more than a year after it came out . <sssss> This version comes with a bonus CD , and the question is whether it adds anything to the " regular " album . <sssss> To which I say : YES ! <sssss> " Ruler of My Heart " is another one of those great mid-tempo tunes , with The Dirty Dozen Brass Band adding some great touches . <sssss> " Cold , Cold Heart " is a great live version , a nice momento for anyone having seen Norah in concert . <sssss> " I 'll Be Your Baby Tonight " finds Norah in top form . <sssss> " Peace " is Norah solo on piano , what a wonderful tune ! <sssss> Highly recommended !
AE31M52VLKOG6	B00005YW4H	5	Come Away with Me is a great CD . <sssss> It has something for every music fan . <sssss> Do n't Know Why has a sexy vulnerability to it that I loved . <sssss> Come Away is a smooth romantic song that I enjoyed very much . <sssss> You 'll love these two songs if you are a fan of jazz or easy listening . <sssss> Turn Me On and Lonestar are sultry sassy tunes . <sssss> You will enjoy these songs if you like country or the blues . <sssss> Norah 's rendition of Hank Williams ' Cold Cold Heart is really pretty too . <sssss> Seven Years is a simple but pretty song about the carefree nature of childhood . <sssss> One Flight Down is a very good song about the effect of music on the human mind . <sssss> I really like it , because it shows that Norah is a talented piano player and an amazing vocalist at the same time . <sssss> Painter Song is a dreamy blissful song about wanting to be with someone . <sssss> Norah Jones ' voice is so soothing and enjoyable . <sssss> This is a great CD .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00005YW4H	3	This album is magical , although is not all that , as many people stated , this album is simple and does not pretend to be anything but good chillout music , this cd attempt to keep you listening and is not in any way radio friendly , you will have to enjoy the whole album , many songs stand out and many fade in memory , but after all this album is worth it for someone , who 's not into jam music ! <sssss> , just good relaxing beats .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B00005YW4H	1	I hate to be a killjoy and rain on your parade , but " Come Away With Me " fell tremendously short of my expectations . <sssss> It 's worse than a bad record ; it 's a bad record that squanders its potential to be good . <sssss> The media hype , Grammy nominations , and chart success finally made me run and grab Norah 's CD . <sssss> I listened with as open a mind as possible , and after just 10 minutes my faith headed south . <sssss> Jones is an able piano player , but she and veteran producer Arif Mardin follow the rules of making a jazz vocal record so slavishly that " Come Away With Me " offers almost no surprises . <sssss> The disc takes off on a promising note with " Do n't Know Why " , a warm and seductive number that fits Norah 's voice like a hand in leather glove . <sssss> But after that , the album lapses into a comatose state from which it never fully recovers . <sssss> The production lacks dimension ; the arrangements are predictable , and Norah 's voice ultimately lacks the urgency to give life to the lyrics . <sssss> " Turn Me On " , " I 've Got To See You Again " , and the " Nearness of You " all start off well , but they ultimately lack substance , nuance , and depth . <sssss> Those who listen exclusively to Top 40 radio will swear to high heaven that " Come Away With Me " is the best thing since sliced bread . <sssss> But more seasoned , mature , and well-rounded listeners will sigh , " heard it all before " . <sssss> If you truly crave for jazz , get the newly remastered deluxe edition of John Coltrane 's " A Love Supreme " or the superb compilation " Verve Unmixed " , which features a smattering of vocal artists from the Verve label . <sssss> Otherwise , save your money .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00005YW4H	5	I had the pleasure of witnessing this young lady live in concert at a local club on March 27 ( # 's in Houston ) and instantly fell in love with her gentle , breezy delivery and smoky , relaxed contralto . <sssss> To see her live is to truly here these songs come to brilliant life ! <sssss> This debut merely hints at her potential and points the way for other young [ people ] to follow . <sssss> This daughter of a legend ( her dad is Ravi Shankar ) has a truly bright future and the music world has a rich new gift in her presence ! <sssss> Do n't miss this !
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B0000634ID	4	When Tweet first came onto the scene , she was mercilessly compared to Ashanti . <sssss> In fact , all the attention shoved on Ashanti hurt her in music sales . <sssss> Although Ashanti may have the edge sales-wise , musically , she ai n't got nothin ' on Tweet . <sssss> Tweet 's voice is very soulful and different from most of the current crop of R&B divas . <sssss> Although she is friends with Missy Elliott and Timbaland , she only works with them on a handful of songs . <sssss> She was determined to use her own talents and not be a producer 's puppet , and it paid off . <sssss> Southern Hummingbird is full of terrific songs . <sssss> Her voice works well in every song , and she has a lot of skill when it comes to songwriting . <sssss> Her most popular song , " Oops ( Oh My ) " is one of the many standouts . <sssss> Off the top of my head , the best ones are " My Place " , " Smoking Cigarettes " , " Always Will " , " Motel " , " Heaven " , and " Drunk " . <sssss> What makes the album even better is a bonus track from Missy Elliott , and " Big Spender " is a good bonus for a terrific album . <sssss> I recommend getting this CD . <sssss> Hopefully , her next CD will get her the respect she deserves . <sssss> She is a star in her own right and should n't have gotten all those comparisons to Ashanti . <sssss> In the meantime , enjoy her terrific first album .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B0000634ID	4	For those people whose response to Tweet is , " Oh God , not another R&B girl " ! <sssss> - Be prepared to say , " I was wrong " . <sssss> Tweet ( real name Charlene Keys ) , is much more India . <sssss> Arie than Ashanti . <sssss> Her music is not as folk R&B as India 's , but Tweet 's music is certainly more soulful , and less studio enhanced , than Ashanti 's debut album . <sssss> Groovy hip-hip , mixed with sultry and smooth jazz elements , makes Tweet 's album a real treat ! <sssss> If you 've heard the first single " Oops ( oh my ) " and are concerned that the entire album is along the same lines musically as this song , rest assured that it is not like that at all . <sssss> " Boogie 2nite " , a personal fave of mine , is a fun , up-tempo song that I can definitely see being a single in the future . <sssss> As for the rest of the album , it ranges , musically , between the two previously mentioned songs . <sssss> From smooth and jazzy , to toe-tapping mid-tempo numbers . <sssss> Of the bonus tracks , " Big Spender " , by Missy Elliott , could have been left off this album . <sssss> The Japanese bonus track " Get Away ( Move On ) " would have been a much better choice . <sssss> Overall , though , this album is well polished and a worth while purchase .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B0000634ID	3	When Tweet was first introduced via Missy 's latest offering Miss E. .... . <sssss> So Addictive , I thought that her voice was very special . <sssss> Like everyone else , I waited to hear more from this song bird , and was extremely let down by the incredibly annoying first single " Oops Oh My " ! <sssss> from her debut album Southern Hummingbird . <sssss> For some reason though I decided to download the album and give it a listen , and I 'm more then happy I did . <sssss> Instead of the sex obsessed RnB songstress that I thought we would be getting , we got a treasure , even though the first single was very misleading . <sssss> Already she has recieved comparisons to India Arie because of her soulful approach over acoustic guitar backdrops , but Arie never made a track as good as " Heaven " or " Beautiful " . <sssss> Being dubbed the female D'Angelo , is more then an honor , and she holds onto the nickname well on songs like " Motel " & " Smoking Cigaretts " . <sssss> You can get up and dance on songs like " Oops Oh My " & " Boogie 2nite " if thats what your looking for here . <sssss> The lyrics are much more deeper then the flat words that we hear today , and this is evident on " Drunk " a silky smooth ballad , whos lyrics mean more then what they actually say , and those who can look deeper into the meaning will be pleased with her sassy approach . <sssss> With Missy behind the work of this album , it loses major points . <sssss> Also , I dont like how background singers were blended in with Tweet while she is singing , something that Missy has done in the past because she does n't have the vocal range that she needs for singing , but its evident that Tweet does have a great vocal range , and its expressed well on the album . <sssss> I hope that she has some more creative control on her next album , but I 'll definetly be giving this one a few more spins .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B0000634ID	4	Missy Elliott had a lot of prot&eacute;g&eacute;es that not only sounded the same , but they had dismal albums ( i.e. <sssss> Nicole and Lil ' Mo ) . <sssss> One of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;es that DID N'T follow this lead is Tweet . <sssss> After hearing a lot of the same old stuff that 's been released lately , it 's good to hear an album this well done . <sssss> This is one of those albums that will have people arguing over which song is the best . <sssss> Tweet has a very beautiful voice ( and she do n't look bad , either ) that is evident throughout the entire album . <sssss> There are fast joints like " Boogie 2nite " and " Make Ur Move " , as well as the # 1 hit " Oops ( Oh My ) " . <sssss> Then she does great on the slow songs . <sssss> Her duet with Bilal on " Best Friend " not only suits HER well , but it should also have more people pick up Bilal 's album 1st Born Second . <sssss> " Drunk " is an interesting feel-sorry-for-yourself track , and " Beautiful " is just that . <sssss> Other songs that should n't be passed up are " Complain " , " Always Will " and " My Place " . <sssss> " Smoking Cigarettes " could use a few more rewrites , and the generic Missy song at the end should have been left off the album . <sssss> ( It 's all right though ; it 's the last song , so just stop after track 16 . <sssss> ) But those slight accidents are easily ignored . <sssss> Tweet needs to stay in the game and show these other singers how it 's done .
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B0000634ID	4	When I first saw Tweet 's " Oops ( Oh My ) " ( featuring Missy ) , I first said , " Oh no , not another Missy protogee who sounds exactly like her other protogees ( Nicole , Lil ' Mo , Gina Thompson , etc. ) " . <sssss> But I heard from numerous people that this album is a treat , so I finally picked it up and I was impressed . <sssss> I agree with other reviewers that " Oops " and " Call Me " are n't good representations of what this album , Southern Hummingbird , is about . <sssss> There are more slow , acoustic , 70s-style soul tunes on here than trendy , Timbaland productions like on those two songs ( not that that 's a bad thing ) . <sssss> But I think that " Oops " and " Call Me " were no-brainers to release in order to get more R&B ; fans ; if she released " Smokin ' Cigarettes " or " Best Friend " ( with Bilal ) , this album probably would have attracted neo-soul fans , and considering the bad rep that neo-soul is starting to get nowadays , why not market Tweet as an R&B ; artist ? <sssss> As is usually the case with R&B ; albums , the best songs are the ones that are not released : " Drunk " has a Prince-esque vibe to it , " My Place " had me wishing I was her man , and " Sexual Healing " is a worthy remix to " Oops " as the beat is so unorthodox it 's funky . <sssss> One song can go and that 's it : " Boogie 2Nite " suffers from a lame chorus . <sssss> Having wrote and / or produced mostly everything herself , this album showcases a new lady in 2002 who actually sing , unlike other R&B ; chicks who sing about being " foolish " . <sssss> Give me Tweet over those girls any day .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B0000634ID	4	Southern Hummingbird is a nice debut from newcomer Tweet . <sssss> After appearing on Timbaland & Magoo 's Indecent Proposal on the song Love Me , I knew that I would have to check out her album . <sssss> Shortly after , she released the song Oops Oh My , which at first I thought was complete garbage . <sssss> But much the same way Aaliyah 's Are You That Somebody pulled me in , Oops Oh My does too . <sssss> That song is classic . <sssss> Tweet does sound like a hummingbird ; she is so mellow and laid back . <sssss> This cd is very relaxing songs such as My Place and Smoking Cigarettes are nice laid back grooves . <sssss> But the album falters toward the end of the cd . <sssss> The songwriting is superb , the topics are off the wall and different from the norm . <sssss> The production is excellent for the most part . <sssss> But the problem is that the cd is hard to get into and does n't smack you in the face like a debut should . <sssss> Nonetheless it is a solid effort , I expect her to work with Timbaland a little more on the next album though to give her that extra punch . <sssss> IF you like Oops Oh My then you will surely like this lp . <sssss> Recommended
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0000634ID	5	My first musical love is r & b - soulful r & b and Tweet more than delivered that on her debut . <sssss> I remember buying her disc at the height of Ashanti-mania and hoped that Tweet 's album would get the recognition it so deserved but ... anyway I got the album with no expectation that it would be a " typical Missy Elliot production " because I am not a huge Missy fan . <sssss> I was overwhelmingly pleasantly surprised by the smooth grooves on this disc . <sssss> I think fans of Tweet are those who appreciate innovative GOOD GROWN FOLKS music not formulaic " hip pop " garbage . <sssss> The only track I did not like is Drunk . <sssss> The tracks that stood out are : Beautiful , Smoking Cigarettes , Motel , Always Will & Best Friend . <sssss> I can not wait for her sophomore effort .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0000634ID	5	This new one from tweet brings the heat once again to the music world with " Southern Humming bird " . <sssss> From the first listen I was hooked and played it through 3 times over . <sssss> The first single " Oops " makes you think this is another timbaland beat heavy cd , with just another R+B girl to sing over . <sssss> Not the case here . <sssss> The cd is very soulful with a lto of different sounds and beats . <sssss> ( fast , midtempo and slow ) No matter how fast or slow the song is ... they all have a soulful vibe to it . <sssss> Missy did it right by bring tweet out in a different way . <sssss> There is also a lot of guitar playing here . <sssss> Makes it sound mroe liek a live session sometimes on some of the songs . <sssss> ( She is a godo live singer ) . <sssss> Now to the songs ... . <sssss> whats good ? <sssss> My place ( reminds you of something D'Angelo would make . <sssss> real soulful ) , Smoking cigarettes , Best Friend ( probably one of the most soulful tracks on the album ) , Always Will , Boogie 2 night ( tight club song ) , Oops ( we all know this . <sssss> the song that started it all ) , Motel ( real soulful with a story behind it ) , beautiful ( Another on of my favorite soulful tracks ) , Heaven , Call me ( Next single with another hot beat ) , Drunk ( Song with another deep story behind it ) , Sexual Healing pt .2 ( Tight remix that makes everythign different ) . <sssss> Overall tweet came strong for her debut and made it clear that its not just another R+B singer here . <sssss> I would not be surprised if she droped a live cd later on ... but for now this is good . <sssss> anyone with doubts about this should pick this up and listen for themself . <sssss> Its a good mix of sounds with a lot of soul . <sssss> Dont sleep .... . <sssss> get it !
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B0000634ID	4	ASHANTI and TWEET ... two new dames of modern R&B whose respective debuts " Ashanti " and " Southern Hummingbird " , dropped on the same day ( April 2 ) . <sssss> After being turned off by Ashanti 's weakly-produceddebut , I was about to call off buying Tweet 's debut BUT one day , after reading the gleaming reviews of fellow Amazonians , I concluded that I give Charlene Keys a chance . <sssss> Turns out that I did a good thing because this sultry southern belle / Missy protege is the real deal . <sssss> And " Southern Hummingbird " is a very honest album . <sssss> Whereas Ashanti talks about boys , boys , and more boys , Tweet talks about real-life issues such as bitternessover a failed relationship , self-worth , alcoholism , and depression . <sssss> Yes , some of these issues may seem depressing but instead of self-pity , Tweet gives hope and optimistism . <sssss> Plus she self-penned the majority of the album , produced much of it , and is an accomplished guitarist and drummer ( Take that Alicia ! <sssss> ) Among the standouts on " Southern " include the steamy " My Place " which highlights Tweet 's sultry , Minnie Ripperton-style voice , the bouncy , Timbaland-helmed " Make Ur Move " and of of course , the sticky smash hit " Oops ! ( Oh My ) " , and the tortured guitar ballads " Motel " and the pretty " Heaven " . <sssss> And I ca n't fail to mention " Smoking Cigarettes " and the duet with Bilal " Best Friend " . <sssss> The few mishaps ( " Call Me " ; " Boogie 2Nite " ) can be forgiven and this southern hummingbird flies away with a impressive debut .
A97B72F4UI8FA	B0000634ID	4	I dont really know why i bought this , as I dont usually listen to R&B . <sssss> I guess i just wanted a change . <sssss> And i am pretty glad for the most part about this purchase . <sssss> Its a really solid debut . <sssss> She wo n't be another alicia keys , or India Arie , and you wont hear another song on the CD like her hit , " Oops ( oh my ) " . <sssss> Its one of the best tracks on the album , but there are alot of tracks that arent gon na be hard to forget on this album . <sssss> She mixes just about everythign that every soul diva of the last year has done and rolls it into one , and the results are great . <sssss> She has the organic acoustic guitar of India Arie , some funky beats like Aaliyah , or Mary J , in songs like Boogie 2Nite . <sssss> Her vocal styles are similar to Alicia Keys , and has the attitude of Angie Stone or Jill Scott . <sssss> There isnt as much vocal slides ( thank God ) as you will find on any of these artists mentioned above . <sssss> I love non - " screamers " , those who use their vocal talent without trying to show it off . <sssss> Its got some good beats , and the unlisted track , Oops ( part 2 ) isnt near as good , and doesnt have much of a beat , but its still pretty cool ... Definately try this CD if you want a fresh breath of air , you 'll probably like it either way .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B0000634ID	3	I would love to say that this album is flawless , but it 's not . <sssss> Most of the songs are excellent , but some of the acoustic guitar songs are just too weak . <sssss> The genres of this album are all over the place . <sssss> Some are very acoustic guitar . <sssss> Some are Timbaland procuced hip hop and R&B or mindless uptempo numbers . <sssss> And then some are more neo-soul , organic ballads . <sssss> Tweet 's melodies are nice , but it 's obvious that the record label was trying to make her go in all different directions with this album and she should 've just chose one .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B0000646TK	4	One of the more talented and precocious young females to emerge within this decade , Vanessa Carlton disappeared way too quickly , and when you think of some of the more successful people she was competing with at the time , this is a sad fact . <sssss> If you want a fresh , unspoiled talent to listen to , I strongly suggest this album . <sssss> The smash hit " A Thousand Miles " ( one of the most justifiably biggest hits of 2002 ) is a great pairing of her sweet singing style with her great piano skills , and this song still gets strong airplay on a lot of soft-rock stations nowadays . <sssss> She also boldly shows off her harder side with her cover of The Rolling Stones ' " Paint It Black " , which is of course not as good as the original , but still very good when you consider how legendary the Stones were / are .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B0000646TK	4	Vanessa Carlton has some really good songs . <sssss> My favorite is probably " Ordinary Day " . <sssss> It 's beautiful and she actually sounds pretty good on it . <sssss> Then of course there is " A Thousand Miles " which has been overplayed to the point of rapture on every radio station in the country . <sssss> I also enjoy " Pretty Baby " and if there is a 3rd single , I hope that it is it . <sssss> And * do n't hurt me * but I also like her cover of " Paint It Black " . <sssss> I think she pulls it off well . <sssss> Then there are other songs that i just ca n't tolerate . <sssss> Vocally , Vanessa Carlton is no better than Britney Spears if you ask me . <sssss> This can be heard , for example , on " Unsung " . <sssss> But she plays piano and songwrites so she can get away with it . <sssss> Still , the album is overall a good listen . <sssss> Buying it for " Ordinary Day " and " Pretty Baby " is well worth it .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B0000646TK	5	I did n't have high hopes when I first bought this CD . <sssss> I liked " A Thousand Miles " and " Ordinary Day " , but they were very overplayed . <sssss> However , I liked " Pretty Baby " and decided to give the album a try . <sssss> I was very surprised to find such a well-rounded CD . <sssss> It is rare to find a CD where the best songs are not the singles . <sssss> The best songs are found in the middle of the album . <sssss> " Rinse " , " Sway " , " Paradise " , " Prince " , " Paint It Black " , and " Wanted " are as flawless as good pop music gets . <sssss> The other songs are good , but there is just something about these songs that stand out to me . <sssss> Many of the magazine reviews I read of this CD were very negative , which surprised me . <sssss> I think she is extremely talented and am looking forward to her next album . <sssss> It will be hard to top this album , but I think Vanessa is capable of it .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B0000646TK	5	Vanessa Carlton is just what the music industry needs more of : Like Alicia Keys , Fiona Apple , and Norah Jones , she is a beautiful young lady who not only has a great voice , but also writes and composes her own music . <sssss> As great as Alicia Keys is , Vanessa is definitely in the same talent pool and equally as good . <sssss> To describe Vanessa 's voice , she 's a combination of Sheryl Crowe and Natalie Imbruglia , with a dash of Nelly Furtado . <sssss> Confused ? <sssss> Buy this disc and you 'll find out what I mean . <sssss> ' A Thousand Miles ' is the ultimate tune , and is rightfully the album 's first single , followed by the enchanting ' Twilght . <sssss> ' The cover of the Rolling Stone 's ' Paint it Black ' does n't do a whole lot for me , but it certainly shows Vanessa 's versatility as an artist . <sssss> She 's pop , jazz , r & b , with a healthy dose of rock , all rolled into one promising artist . <sssss> I 'm certainly not disappointed with this disc , and I do n't think anyone else who appeciates good music will be let down either .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B0000646TK	4	So I decided to post that . <sssss> Here it is : 1 . <sssss> Ordinary Day2 . <sssss> Unsung3 . <sssss> A Thousand Miles4 . <sssss> Pretty Baby5 . <sssss> Rinse6 . <sssss> Sway7 . <sssss> Paradise8 . <sssss> Prince9 . <sssss> Paint It Black10 . <sssss> Wanted11 . <sssss> TwilightOkay , now on to the review . <sssss> This CD is pretty good I must admit . <sssss> While at times Vanessa can come off as whiny , all of these songs ( minus maybe two of them ) sound so different it keeps you interested . <sssss> Vanessa is n't the strongest lyricist but her words do the trick . <sssss> Highlights : Ordinary Day , Rinse , Paradise , Paint It Black and definitely Twilight which is probably the best track here . <sssss> A Thousand Miles is good too but it is n't my favorite anymore . <sssss> Lastly , I would like to say although this release is close to stellar , her follow up ( which flopped ) Harmonium , is the better CD . <sssss> I do recommend it over this one because of songs like Who 's To Say , Afterglow , Private Radio , Half A Week Before Winter and She Floats . <sssss> Certainly great songs . <sssss> But all in all , I believe that if you like pop music that is n't too poppy , and you 're into something with some meaning , a lot of sadness mixed with loneliness and longing , and a unique feel and vibe for nearly every song , then you should get this CD . <sssss> ^_^ 4.2 stars .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B0000646TK	4	Be Not Nobody is the debut album from Vanessa Carlton . <sssss> It is not her best as Harmonium and Heroes and Thieves but nonetheless , Vanessa 's voice and songwriting showed amazing potential back then . <sssss> Some of the songs are gorgeous like Ordinary Day , Sway , Twilight , Wanted , Paradise , and of course A Thousand Miles . <sssss> Some songs do n't stick like the previous ones I mentioned but I think Carlton was just finding her voice in 2002 and she more than made up for it with her last two LPs . <sssss> There are some stunning moments on Be Not Nobody but you want real magic then check out her later works instead . <sssss> Good luck !
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B0000646TK	4	Music fans everywhere were patiently waiting for Vanessa Carlton 's debut album to drop . <sssss> They had no choice , because " A Thousand Miles " came out way back in January ( at least ) , yet this album did n't come out until almost four months later . <sssss> That was worrying some people because many times when a female artist pushes an album back that far , the end result is n't that outstanding . <sssss> Fortunately , that 's not the case here . <sssss> Be Not Nobody is an interesting album full of inventive singing , creative lyrics and , of course , Vanessa 's exceptional piano work . <sssss> The rhythmic " Unsung " is your basic how-do-I-tell-him-how-I-feel song , and " Twilight " is a rather emotional tale of the end result when she does n't reveal her true feelings . <sssss> " Paradise " is similar to " Twilight " except it 's about another woman 's lost chance , while a mellow feel-sorry-for-yourself message can be found in " Paint It Black " . <sssss> Also be sure not to miss the cool melody of the best track , " Pretty Baby " . <sssss> The music is something else that should n't be ignored . <sssss> Vanessa especially shines on " Wanted " ( where the man thinks she 's too good for him ) , but all instruments work well together on the catchy " Sway " , where the synthesizer is rediscovered . <sssss> One thing people should keep in mind is that Vanessa 's singing should not be taken lightly . <sssss> Because of this , some people may argue that she ca n't sing . <sssss> But with this style of music , you have to remember that there 's a little bit of rock mixed in . <sssss> With that said , you should go get this album .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B0000646TK	3	Though anticipation for Vanessa Carlton 's debut had been mounting up until the time of its ' release ( largely thanks to the first-rate single ' A Thousand Miles ' ) , one spin of BE NOT NOBODY leaves the impression that the hype was a little unjustified . <sssss> Granted , ' A Thousand Miles ' is superb , and a few of the other cuts are n't bad ( ' Ordinary Day ' , ' Pretty Baby ' ) , but listening makes one wonder where all those Tori / Fiona comparisons are coming from , other than from people who do n't listen to either of those artists . <sssss> Carlton lacks not only the emotional starkness and vocal ability of Apple , but also the lyrical directness that marks Amos ' best work . <sssss> Seriously , it seems as though it is now prerequisite to compare any woman sitting behind a piano to either Amos or Apple , or both . <sssss> BE NOT NOBODY is a pleasant enough debut , but I 'm afraid she 's going to have to go much more than a ' thousand miles ' to come close to the Tori / Fiona axis that everyone is so eager to lump her in .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B0000646TK	4	When I listened to the CD for the first time , I found it to be one of the best masterpieces I 've heard in a long time . <sssss> She is one of the very few artists who can write their own songs and sing them so delightfully . <sssss> Her track " A Thousand Miles " is her best track , especially with the piano parts . <sssss> The bridge is my favorite part of the song . <sssss> Vanessa gives a new vibe to the Rolling Stones classic " Paint It Black " . <sssss> Though Vanessa is , in no question , one of the best new artists , the only reason I gave " Be Not Nobody " 4.8 stars instead of 5 is because of the track " Wanted " . <sssss> I feel that the vocal and piano blending was a little off . <sssss> It seems like two opposite songs playing at once . <sssss> Other than that , if you listen to this CD , I will guarantee your 100 % satisfaction !
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B0000646TK	1	Yes , Vanessa Carlton can play the piano . <sssss> Yes , she can write her own songs . <sssss> However , she can not sing worth a dime and her debut album is nothing short of boring . <sssss> The lovely single " A Thousand Miles " is the best track here , while " Ordinary Day " is a close second . <sssss> Other than the songs previously mentioned , " Be Not Nobody " is full of weak songwriting and production that almost tries to be like " Little Earthquakes " by Tori Amos . <sssss> I do give Vanessa credit for writing every song but one on this album , but I still fail to see why she 's so popular .
A5889INEGKCQY	B0000646TK	2	One Of the worst albums I 've ever listened to . <sssss> This girl may have some talent but she better start using it . <sssss> She can play a piano but she surely ca n't write songs nor sing . <sssss> this album laks both vocally , lyricly and artisticly . <sssss> no originality here , no fun , just plain boredom . <sssss> No risks envolved . <sssss> This girl is 22 when I saw the video for Thousand Miles I thought she was 13 . <sssss> Just a Commercial bubblegum pop with no soul and no heart put into it . <sssss> I Know it 's her debut so I 'll give it 2 stars but other than that she needs to do better material . <sssss> So maybe next time .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B0000646TK	3	i was very curious about Vanessa Carlton so I had to hear Her material . <sssss> for me personally She & Alicia Keys are kinda along the same lines overall to me . <sssss> maybe it 's the Classical Piano Vibe they both come from . <sssss> they both have alright Voices but not quite fully developed yet . <sssss> as for the Material here : certain things work some do n't . <sssss> A thousand Miles reminds me of Mid 80 's Bruce Hornsby & the Range . <sssss> but Her Cover of the Stones " Paint it Black " is neck in neck with Brittney 's Weak take on " Satisfaction " not a Smart Move . <sssss> with Carlton 's background in Classical I think doing what the Verve did with " Bitter Sweet Symphony " would have worked better to me . <sssss> needless to say this set is better than Average & there is Hope . <sssss> She has a nice Pop Sound .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B0000646TK	5	It is nice to see a fun , light hearted , piano player in the mix of guitar playing bad girls . <sssss> Carlton blends beautiful orchestration with adictive piano chords and the results are beauiful songs such as " A Thousand Miles " and the absolutly stunning " Twilight " . <sssss> Personally " Ordinary Day " is my favorive , but that 's because one ca n't help but smile at its cuteness . <sssss> I really hope that she is not lost in the mob of chick-rockers .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B0000646TK	5	This is a very good CD . <sssss> Vanessa Carlton has a beautiful voice and is a talented piano player . <sssss> The best song on this CD is the upbeat A Thousand Miles , but there are several others just as excellent . <sssss> Ordinary Day has the same soaring quality of A Thousand Miles . <sssss> It reminds us to make the most of every day , and that we have the ability to make our dreams come true . <sssss> I love Vanessa 's rendition of the Rolling Stones song Paint it Black . <sssss> It is a very energetic song with a great drum beat . <sssss> Not every song on this CD is as happy the first few . <sssss> Nevertheless , I found the lyrics to be very thoughtful . <sssss> Rinse is about the inability of trying to cleanse yourself of someone who is destroying your self image . <sssss> Twilight is a song about learning to appreciate our life from someone whose life is near the twilight or the end . <sssss> The main message of this song is that we should never take life for granted . <sssss> Be Not Nobody has variety of themes and moods on it . <sssss> I enjoyed it very much .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000646TK	5	Vanessa Carlton debut album came into the light of the music business , between the years that gaves us Furtado , Lavigne , and Branch , not to compare any of the four girls , because each debut album of their are supreme pop-rock records . <sssss> What sets Carlton apart from the rest is the sensational debut single " A THOUSAND MILES " the song enbodies great fast beat with clever driven lyrics , this track would be a classic song for years to come , the explanation of an unconditional love in this song is simple and true . <sssss> " ORDINARY DAY " was the second track deliver to radio waves , a most intimate downtempo , emotional deliver song . <sssss> " PRETTY BABY " the last cut to make it to the mainstream is a devotional song about your love one . <sssss> In conclution Carlton debut album delivers an emotional rollercoaster of POP-AC music fittable in mainstream wave , this is a delight to the ear .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B000065625	4	I bought this CD the week it came out . <sssss> I was really excited to listen to it because it did n't seem like it would sound like anything else out there . <sssss> Turns out my hunch was right . <sssss> This album seems like we , the listeners , are put inside Lauryn Hill 's head where we get to hear songs that are works in progress . <sssss> We also get to hear her monologues that tell us a lot about what it 's like to be Lauryn Hill . <sssss> Some magazine reviews I read said that they wish the spoken interludes had been taken out because they made LH sound self-absorbed . <sssss> I for one am glad they were put on there . <sssss> They really make you feel like you are right there in the room with her . <sssss> I also love how some of the songs are very rough and unpolished . <sssss> The most intense moment comes when she breaks down and starts crying . <sssss> She really makes you feel the song and it 's impossible not to feel the same way she does . <sssss> If you like your music to sound like it was labored over in a studio , skip this album . <sssss> This is the most personal album I have ever listened to . <sssss> The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it can be a little uncomfortable to listen to at times , but it is still a terrific album .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B000065625	4	Let 's face it , 1998 's ' THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL ' is one of the best R&B / Hip-Hop albums ever produced by anyone . <sssss> It is truly an untouchable work of art ! <sssss> So , how does one follow-up a masterpiece ? <sssss> By releaseing a live , acoustic album full of raw , intense emotion that gives listerners chills . <sssss> To say that Lauryn Hill did n't produce a good 2nd solo effort would be unfair , though not everyone will like it ( even those that are fans of her '98 solo debut ) . <sssss> This album is a totally different recording than ' MISEDUCATION . <sssss> ' No studio enhancement , groovy hip-hop , or consistently clear vocals . <sssss> Recorded live , Lauryn 's voice cracks often ( which did n't happen at all on ' MISEDUCATION ' ) . <sssss> That is really my only complaint , that and the long interludes do n't make this recording as smooth as ' MISEDUCATION . <sssss> ' Yet , Lauryn 's emotions and amazing social awareness make up for any technical flaws . <sssss> ' Rebel ' is my favourite song , with lyrics that speak of pain and social injustice . <sssss> Devoted Hill fans will be pleased by this double-length live album . <sssss> But do n't expect this album to sell 6 million + copies like ' MISEDUCATION . <sssss> ' In order for a person to truly like this album , one must have an ear for beautiful , soulful music at its very best .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B000065625	5	I could wrtie a long review about this but instead i 'll let me rating speak for itsself . <sssss> L-boogie is on a different level now and I think she has really began to find herself . <sssss> I relate to a lot of what she said but many will be surprised of some of the things she says . <sssss> All her songs are str8 forward and preachy sometimes but have a good message . <sssss> Overall I think what she is trying to say is that you cant let religous leaders or anyone else tell you how to live your life ... you have to listen to that inner voice and learn things for yourself . <sssss> Living life for other people and not you makes you a lost person in thier own image of you . <sssss> The songs I was really feeling are : Just like Water , Mr. Intentiohnal , Oh jerusalem , Freedom time , Mystery of iniquity , and So much things to say . <sssss> Overall she really came on a strong vibe with this new one and fans should nto be disappointed . <sssss> I definetly was not . <sssss> This will be up there with the " Best of " when it come sto live albums . <sssss> I cant wait for the next studio release . <sssss> Get it !
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000065625	1	Lauryn Hill is having a breakdown , right before our ears . <sssss> Not only is this a bad album , but it makes you wonder why it was even made . <sssss> I understand she 's working through some stuff , but she does n't make a lick of sense . <sssss> I do n't understand why this is called " music " since she plays the same three chords over and over , and all the songs have the same meandering nonsense . <sssss> I do n't think I 've ever laughed this hard . <sssss> Girlfriend is telling us about her boxes and purging , repenting and its too much !
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B000065625	1	The saddest fall from grace since Dylan 's " Self Portrait " . <sssss> Seemingly unrehearsed , off key , incoherent mumblings about stardom , religious platitudes , Bossa Nova , Reggae , Pop , R&B and a whole lotta talkin ' , it 's just Hill and her acoustic guitar - for 2 interminable CD 's . <sssss> Ya ca n't fault a girl her convictions and passion , but that affectivity gets buried from the longwinded chunter to the point of exhaustion . <sssss> She seems less than the whole of her talent and ability . <sssss> Her debut solo CD was a revelation ... and while I do not want to fall into the trappings of comparison , there has to be some sort of cohesion - there should be more self-respect to her craft than whining at her version of the Wailing Wall and releasing it to an unsuspecting fan base . <sssss> If it 's so dreadful being famous , then stop being famous . <sssss> Oh , wait . <sssss> Mission accomplished . <sssss> My grade : D
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B000065625	3	I ca n't even listen to this cd . <sssss> This cd makes me sad because I am a HUGE Lauryn 's fan and its clear that she is dealing with some serious personal problems . <sssss> I can deal with the songs because she deals with real life , but her voice just make this cd not enjoyable at all . <sssss> Her voice cracks and at times , I thought she was having a breakdown right there on the stage . <sssss> This cd may mean something in the future , but right now this cd is NOT worth mentioning . <sssss> I hear her next cd is like nothing we have ever heard and that its rock and soul . <sssss> I pray that Lauryn rid herself of her demons and the bad people in her life . <sssss> I just want her to be ok and to make good music again .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000065625	2	funny how just a few Years Back Lauryn Hill was the Toast of the Biz . <sssss> when you hear this Set you have to be reminded of that time because this two-Set will make you think what Happened ?? <sssss> the Guitar Playing & Her Arrangements go nowhere they just are like One Long Random Play that has no Start , Middle or End . <sssss> Her Voice is n't that strong over the course of the set either . <sssss> I give Her Props for Being Daring to drop a Double Live Set but that 's as far as it goes . <sssss> this Set Crashes before it has a chance to turn the Corner .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000065625	4	Lauryn Hill 's " Unplugged " , her first release in 4 years , is a double CD of stellar , first-rate acoustic new material weighed down by too much talking . <sssss> Hill does n't seem confident enough to let her music to speak for itself , so she rambles on in between songs about relationships , her rise to fame , and so forth . <sssss> Track one of the 40-minute disc 2 is TWELVE minutes of Hill preaching , talking , and sermonizing . <sssss> Lawd , is this sista long-winded ! <sssss> If you were to eliminate all the monologues , you 'd probably be able to fit the songs onto one CD . <sssss> Yet , despite that major complaint , " Unplugged " still merits 4 stars because the new songs are breathtakingly good . <sssss> Bob Marley 's influence prevades the songs ; it 's as if his spirit haunted Hill during the making of these jams . <sssss> It 's just Hill , her guitar , and the audience . <sssss> No samples . <sssss> No drum machine . <sssss> No band . <sssss> Minimalism rarely sounds this good . <sssss> So , the verdict is this : get the album if you love Hill and do n't mind listening to her interact with the audience at great lengths . <sssss> But casual listeners may be put off and should probably stick with her debut , " The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill " .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B000065625	5	This is the unflinching sound of an artist excorcising some serious demons . <sssss> While many people do n't view this as a viable form of commercial entertainment , a small number of us find it utterly fascinating . <sssss> I happen to be very fond of the melody and guitar playing on " Mr. Intentional " and enjoy her between-song rantings , she 's committed the ultimate act of bravery here by baring her soul and presenting herself and her music in such an honest fashion . <sssss> This is the kind of release that will confound old fans for quite sometime , but after a few years and some maturity , they 'll understand . <sssss> Baring one 's soul is always risky , but for a Grammy winning artist ( especially one previously known as a rapper ) to undergo such a stunning and public transformation is pure genius and makes her all the more endearing to me . <sssss> To borrow the Title of my other current favorite LP , " Just Listen " .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B000067CPX	3	I knew that the Chili Peppers would n't be able to touch the material that they released on their best album to date , 1999 's Californication . <sssss> However , By the Way is still a highly infectious effort , backed up with intelligent lyrics , an amazing band & a chemistry that can not be denied . <sssss> When these men hit up the studio , you know that you will get a hit every single time . <sssss> After 3 years of high anticipation this super group returns with their latest album . <sssss> The first single " By the Way " is absolutely fantastic . <sssss> It features the two sides of the Peppers blended perfectly together : mellow acoustic rock & straight up heavy rock . <sssss> The album 's best track however is " Dosed " . <sssss> The track is incredible and would have fit perfectly on Californication . <sssss> The boys are leaning more on the mellow rock music on this album however , which is clearly evident on " Universally Speaking " , " This is the Place " , " Do n't Forget Me " & " I Could Die For You " The first group to really hit us with the rock-rap mixture , keeps their reputation strong mixing in songs like " Ca n't Stop " & " Minor Thing " . <sssss> The material is also still very futuristic , and the boys still love trying new things . <sssss> Perfect Examples of this are songs like " The Zephyr Song " , " Throw Away Your T.V. " & " Venice Queen " . <sssss> Two songs that you should definetly check out also are " Midnight " & " Cabron " . <sssss> The Red Hot Chili Peppers were hot in the 80 's and prove that they have amazing staying power in this industry by remaining to be one of music 's best acts in the present times . <sssss> Their rebelious attitudes has put them in a catigory all their own , because unlike all the other rock acts out there now , they refused to follow guide-lines that were pre-set and follow their own legacy . <sssss> Maybe thats why so many bands have fallen off and the Chili Peppers are just as spicy now as they ever were .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B000067CPX	4	By the Way being RHCP 's 2002 release and their 8th studio album was met with positive reviews from the critiques with Allmusic , Rolling Stone and Q giving it 4/5 . <sssss> The album spawned 5 singles . <sssss> These being " By the Way " , " The Zephyr Song " , " Ca n't Stop " , " Dosed " and " Universally Speaking " . <sssss> The booklet is a mixed bag . <sssss> It has some all the lyrics and but not a list of whom plays what . <sssss> The photographs of the band is great but the font is so so . <sssss> The cover makes no sense and I have no idea what they want to convey with this . <sssss> 4/5 .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B000067CPX	5	Funky fresh ... those are the words I choose to describe the Peppers ' latest . <sssss> Yes , they bring ' da funk to the table here , but they also , for once in their stinkin ' careers , decided to bring ' da melody ... which makes for a great album . <sssss> It seems Kiedis & ' da boyz decided to invigorate their tiring formula by instituting Beach Boys-like harmonies to the mix , which works splendidly . <sssss> It 's good that ' da drugz & alcohol ai n't affectin ' the Peppers like they used to . <sssss> Now sober , these guys are a harmonic force to be reckoned with ... . <sssss> THEY 'RE ALMOST LIKE A POPULAR " EMO " BAND THESE DAYS ! <sssss> HAVE FUN !!!!!!! 
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B000067CPX	5	I 'm not exactly a huge fan of RHCP but I do like some of their songs , mostly from their previous album " Californication " . <sssss> I was n't even planning on buying " By the Way " but as I heard the title track more and more , I grew to love the song . <sssss> I knew I had to get the album . <sssss> I have heard quite a bit of RHCP 's earlier music back in the early '90s , late '80s . <sssss> I definitely like the band 's recent material . <sssss> I just ca n't get into their more raw , hip hop infused rock music . <sssss> I like the more mature sound that the Chili Peppers have obviously developed in the past few years . <sssss> I really loved how the Chili Peppers did a 180 and incorporated orchestral strings in " Midnight " and flamenco guitar in " Cabron " . <sssss> I especially dug " Cabron " . <sssss> Anthony 's voice sounds so rich and warm . <sssss> " Dosed " , " Tear " , and " The Zephyr Song " are two of the most gorgeous RHCP ballads I have ever heard , and to be honest I have never been wild about their ballads up until " Californication " and now " By the Way " . <sssss> Those three tracks are simply stunning to listen to . <sssss> Despite my dislike for the band 's earlier music , I always did think that Anthony Kiedis had a awesome voice . <sssss> He sounds better than ever on " By the Way " . <sssss> I am all for growth in a band 's sound , especially for a band that has been around for as long as the Red Hot Chili Peppers been . <sssss> To expect the band to keep churning out " Blood Sugar Sex Magic " is awfully selfish for fans . <sssss> " By the Way " is just a awesome rock record . <sssss> Probably the best rock record in mainstream music right now .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B000067CPX	4	Does anyone else chuckle when others refer to the 91 and 95 albums as " Old Chili Peppers " ? <sssss> The 1987 record is my favorite . <sssss> I guess that 's what I get for being 31 . <sssss> As has been stated , this is a great album . <sssss> Lots of melody , hooks , and " singing " . <sssss> It 's apparent that the 1980 's Pepper 's have left the building . <sssss> BUT , times change and we all grow up . <sssss> RHCP 's have the same right to change their sound as U2 and others have . <sssss> It should tell you something that Amazon is trying to sell this with a " Dave Matthews " album , and not one from " Bad Brains " or " 311 " . <sssss> Anyway , regardless of when you came into the Chili Peppers career , you 'll most likely enjoy this . <sssss> It 's good .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B000067CPX	5	The Red Hot Chili Peppers have become as reliable as U2 and REM in the past two decades . <sssss> Like the other two bands , TRHCP have straddled the fine line of making broadly appealing music without exactly losing their souls to corporations . <sssss> Yes , " By The Way " sounds like their most commercial cd to date , but as fans we have their first four cds that were not commercial to reflect on . <sssss> I do n't think the band is completely commercial anyway , and I do n't they could be . <sssss> I mean , my father would n't buy " By The Way " . <sssss> Instead , the band is attracting new , younger listeners while keeping many of the old fans . <sssss> With that said , " By The Way " is a solid recording with the band 's usual range of offerings from " By The Way " , " Universally Speaking " , " The Zephyr Song " , " Cabron " and the rest of the 12 other tracks . <sssss> The cd holds together very well , staying consistent throughout . <sssss> Some might say this is a continuation from " Californication " and they 'd be right . <sssss> " By The Way " has the same lush feeling , the same maturity and growth in song structure and lyrics . <sssss> The band is at the beginning of greatness I believe , with many more cds ahead that in years to come will be as classic as any U2 or REM cd .
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI	B000067CPX	3	Hear me out before you vote this not-helpful , AGE can be a wonderful thing . <sssss> As we all know , the older you get the wiser and more savvy you become . <sssss> YET again , the older you get the rustier you can become . <sssss> See artists like Sade do n't have these problems . <sssss> They 're both older and wiser YET still vital . <sssss> The Red Hot ChiliPeppers can also attest . <sssss> These guys emerged in the mid - '80s withtheir groovy funk-rock stylings and party ready lyrics . <sssss> From wearing socks on their " chili peppers " to wearing fire extingusher hats , RHCP have evolved . <sssss> So with 1999 's " Californication " , the men showed a consistent maturity and age old wisdom . <sssss> These guys have went through dead bandmates , heavy drug problems , floundering sales , several lineup changes buthave still survived . <sssss> For that alone they deserve a pat on the back . <sssss> Now RHCP followup the very well-recieved , multiplatinum " Californication " with " By The Way " . <sssss> Less in-you-face than say , " Give It Away " or " All Around The World " , " BTW " relies more on moody arrangements and again , sobering maturity . <sssss> The title track is mellow and features Anthony Kiedis ' aging yetstill strong vocals . <sssss> Defintely one of the stronger songs on mainstream rock radio . <sssss> The vauldville-like " Carbon " , " Tear " , " Universally Speaking " , and the awe-inducing finale " Venice Queen " all are worth checking out . <sssss> In fact , there is n't really a bad song on here . <sssss> Some filler but no flat out bad composition . <sssss> Yet RHCP seem to be wearing their age a lot on this album . <sssss> Keidis ' voice is wearing , Flea 's playing is slighty less funkier , Chad Smith 's rhythms are a little redundant . <sssss> Fruscante ' splaying is superior but not masterful . <sssss> And the album is just notthat exciting as " Blood Sugar Sex Magik " or " Californication " . <sssss> RHCP are survivors and they deserve respect . <sssss> Although FISHBONE were the originators who NEVER GOT THEIR PROPS ! <sssss> ( Can you tellI 'm a little bitter ? <sssss> - LOL ) , RHCP still can rock at thier advanced ages . <sssss> " By The Way " is a solid album but it 's just not something that 'll blow your mind . <sssss> Well at least , they 're not in rockers yet .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B000067CPX	4	I somehow feel that this is part of a new era of Red Hot Chili Peppers , some thought they had changed with their music when " Californication " was released 3 years ago , and they were right , " By the Way " continues were " Califorication " left off . <sssss> But this is the real Red Hot Chili Peppers , they are being themselves now and doing their own things in music . <sssss> Who thougt they would still be around back in 1992 when they were at their peak ? <sssss> This is a good Album which is very easy to listen too aswell . <sssss> There are diffrent kinds of tracks too , some catchy rock songs and some slower ballads aswell and shows why they have changed . <sssss> John Frusciante who came back to the band in 1999 , is as awesome with the guitar as always and Anthony Keilis voice is smooth and strong and Flea and Chad Smith are solid . <sssss> Best songs are defenitely the title track in midpace " By the way " energic rockers " Ca n't Stop " and " The Zephyr Song " and both " Minor thing " & " Venice Queen " grows on you too but i would say that most songs are worth listening to , slow " Universally Speaking " is also a gem . <sssss> 16 songs are included on this album , one of the better Peppers album in a long time full of potential hit singles and good rocksongs . <sssss> Defenitely worth a go , even if you 're no fan of them .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000067CPX	3	I have n't been much of a fan of this Band because I always say they have Jacked Fishbone 's Career among others . <sssss> standard Production here that they usually do much difference with there Vocal Performance . <sssss> I heard this Set on MTV 2 on there Play-back show . <sssss> Instrumentation is along the lines of most of there stuff during the past Decade . <sssss> " Tear " was a Interesting cut . <sssss> they have one or two songs on there Albums that usually get your attention but I have n't heard a whole Album by them that has fully gotten me .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B00006I4YD	4	Do n't get me wrong . <sssss> This cd has excellent songs ( Amber Waves , I ca n't see New York , Crazy , Carbon , ext ) . <sssss> The only problem is that if you 're looking for something like Little Earthquakes , you 'll be dissapointed . <sssss> The songs are beautiful , but her piano playin lacks the passion that it did before , as does her vocals . <sssss> If you 're a new fan , pick up Little Earthquakes , Under the Pink and From the Choirgirl Hotel . <sssss> This are her best albums up to date .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00006I4YD	4	Tori Amos came back at us with another one of her albums that showcases the usual : her great piano work , the introspective soundscape backing her up ( especially the drums and the strings ) , and her picture-painting lyrics . <sssss> But in case you do n't know yet , Tori 's music is n't for everyone , so if you could n't get into her previous work , you probably wo n't be able to get into this album either . <sssss> The leadoff single " A Sorta Fairytale " is actually more accessible than some of the other songs she 's done . <sssss> It 's a bittersweet song that should hit home with a lot of people . <sssss> Another song that should hit home ( with women , anyway ) is " Another Girl 's Paradise " , which is a clever way of interpreting the school of thought that " nothing good ever lasts forever " . <sssss> And I 'm not sure , but I think " I Ca n't See New York " is a roundabout way of talking about the September 11th attacks . <sssss> My favorite songs on this album would have to " Mrs. Jesus " and " Do n't Make Me Come To Vegas " . <sssss> The rest of the album is overall solid as well . <sssss> But I gave the album four stars because it runs a little long ( 74 minutes ) and because I do n't think Tori 's song is working well with the production in " Carbon " . <sssss> But that 's just my opinion . <sssss> Scarlet 's Walk is definitely worth picking up .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00006I4YD	5	The follow-up to last year 's near-disastrous covers album STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS , Tori Amos rebounds magnificently with SCARLET 's WALK , arguably her strongest and most cohesive collection since her seminal masterpiece LITTLE EARTHQUAKES . <sssss> While the sonically adventurous FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL and TO VENUS AND BACK were both strong records , both also found Amos experimenting with a far less straightforward writing style than was present on her first two albums . <sssss> SCARLET 'S WALK finds her returning to a more accessible sound , with her piano back front and center on many tracks , though she has n't completely given up the full band sound that she used on her previous two studio sets . <sssss> Though conceived as a concept album , the album 's songs are all strong enough to stand independent of each other . <sssss> And Amos presents some of her most gorgeously melodic work to date -- witness ' Amber Waves ' , ' a sorta fairytale ' , ' Crazy ' , and ' Taxi Ride ' , just to name four , all enhanced with beautifully layered harmony work . <sssss> All in all , this stands as one of the best records released in the last year -- those disenchanted with Amos ' recent work would do well to return to the fold ASAP .
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B00006I4YD	5	After being very disappointed with her monotonous covers album , ' Strange Little Girls ' , and only mildly taken with her last studio album , ' To Venus And Back ' , I was a little skeptic about buying ' Scarlet 's Walk ' . <sssss> When I heard " A Sorta Fairytale " on the radio , however , it sort of reminded me of two of my favorite Tori Amos songs , " Cruel " and " God " . <sssss> So naturally ( being the Tori fan that I am ) I decided to give the album a go , but with very low expectations . <sssss> The first time I listened to ' Scarlet 's Walk ' , I admit to being a little shattered with a not too good impression , but after giving it several run-throughs it began to grow on me , which made me feel very relieved . <sssss> If I did n't like this album I was afraid that I would no longer be able to call myself a Tori Amos fan because of recent let-downs , but songs like the quirky " Wednesday " ( which brings me back to her ' Boys For Pele ' days ) , " Crazy " , " Sweet Sangria " , " Taxi Ride " and ( my personal favorite ) " Scarlet 's Walk " make this all worth the purchase . <sssss> What makes this album even more interesting is the fact that Tori wrote this on a cross-country road trip , which she took shortly after the terrorist attacks . <sssss> And while this album is nothing like my favorite Tori album , ' From The Choirgirl Hotel ' , at times it reminds me of ' Little Earthquakes ' ( my second favorite ) but is best to be compared to ' Under The Pink ' . <sssss> ' Scarlet 's Walk ' is much lighter and not so dark in mood as previous albums , but is still guaranteed to please most fans of Tori 's earlier works .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B00006I4YD	5	Tori Amos has once again given us an incredible masterpiece in the form of &lt; b > Scarlet 's Walk &lt; / b > . <sssss> Taking us on a journey of 18 songs that formed the basis of the afterthoughts following the September 11 incident . <sssss> Choice tracks include the lead-off single A Sorta Firytale , Amber Waves , Taxi Ride and Gold Dust . <sssss> Tori shows great panache on such tracks where her inner angst and exasperation has been relegated to seond priority as she explores greater issues such as finding an American identity . <sssss> Great album following Bruce Springsteen 's The Rising .
AXFI7TAWD6H6X	B00006I4YD	5	It almost seems like an eternity that I heard new , original material from Tori Amos . <sssss> Last year 's " Strange Little Girls " was an album of cover songs so I do n't consider that new music . <sssss> I have been waiting for " Scarlet 's Walk " since this past summer and anticipated it with baited breath . <sssss> According to comments I have read over the internet , the album was going to be more accessible and in some ways , a return to the days of " Little Earthquakes " and " Under the Pink " . <sssss> When I first heard " A Sorta Fairytale " , I immediately fell under its spell and was more excited to hear Tori 's new album . <sssss> Needless to say , I immediately rushed out to buy " Scarlet 's Walk " when the record store near my work opened up ( and when it was time for my break ) . <sssss> It is safe to say that this album surpasses all expectations I had for it . <sssss> The mood of this album definiteliy hearkens back to " Little Earthquakes " and " Under the Pink " . <sssss> According to what I have read , " Scarlet 's Walk " is the result of last year 's tour after the terrorist attacks on September 11 . <sssss> I really ca n't put it into the words but I can feel Tori 's emotions that resulted in this album . <sssss> There is a certain somberness and melancholy that just breaks my heart in tracks like " I Ca n't See New York " and " Taxi Ride " . <sssss> In some ways , that melancholy reminds me a whole lot like " Little Earthquakes " . <sssss> I ca n't believe I 'm saying this but " Scarlet 's Walk " has just knocked out " From the Choirgirl Hotel " from the top spot of my favorite Tori Amos albums , and definitely album of the year without a question of a doubt .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B00006I4YD	4	This is probably Amos 's most consistent work since " Little Earthquakes " and " Under The Pink " . <sssss> 18 tracks that are extremely consistent and coherent . <sssss> A gentle ride , with soft edges , Amos explores her usual topics of religion , spirituality , self-exploration and relationships served up Tori-style replete with abstractions and random song references like Prince 's " When Doves Cry " . <sssss> With many songs to choose from here , I felt the following were highlights : " Amber Waves " , " a sorta fairytale " , " Wednesday " , " do n't make me come to Vegas " , " your cloud " , " I ca n't see New York " , " mrs. jesus " and " Taxi Ride " . <sssss> The packaging of " Scarlet 's Walk " special edition is interesting with little trinkets and photographs in the form of postcards . <sssss> I liked it . <sssss> The dvd left something to be desired . <sssss> This a new medium and musicians seem to be fumbling around for a direction to take with their dvd ( Tom Petty wisely chose to do a making of with his ) . <sssss> The dvd has three songs from the cd done in a documentary style filming -- which , while it 's nice to see Tori Amos , was a bit boring and not really worth inclusion . <sssss> That said , Amos fans , like myself , should be satisfied with this release .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00006I4YD	4	Tori returns with a new album of new material , after last year 's critically acclaimed STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS . <sssss> Even though I felt distanced from that project , it was an interesting concept . <sssss> SCARLET 'S WALK is another concept album . <sssss> Through 18 tracks , we follow the journey of a woman and the many people she encounters on a trip across America . <sssss> This is the perfect road trip CD . <sssss> The lyrics are not as complicated and abstact as on BOYS FOR PELE or TO VENUS AND BACK , but more reminiscent of CHOIRGIRL or UNDER THE PINK . <sssss> " A Sorta Fairytale " is classic Tori , and the perfect song to lead the album with a single . <sssss> " I Ca n't Find New York " is to me the centerpiece of the album , a song that I believe to be about being on one of the planes that crashed . <sssss> " Your Cloud " has a nice sentiment about individuality and appreciating a relationship . <sssss> Other highlights include " Gold Dust " , " Taxi Ride " , " Carbon " and " Scarlet 's Walk " . <sssss> If you 're buying this limited edition version , you get a bunch of extras . <sssss> A road map , the lyrics , a charm , stickers , polaroid photos , and a bonus DVD . <sssss> The CD also unlocks goodies on her site . <sssss> Overall Tori is back on solid footing with SCARLET 'S WALK .
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B00006I4YD	3	Here we go again , folks : yet another dismal , heartless release from Tori Amos . <sssss> I should n't be surprised , because her 2001 release , " Strange Little Girls " , was just an excuse to fulfill her contract with Atlantic Records . <sssss> I liked " Strange Little Girls " for what it was , but I ca n't believe that Tori has come out with " Scarlet 's Walk " , an album full of cliches and recycled material . <sssss> The whole concept of this album is quite ridiculous : Tori thought she 'd be treading new territory by writing an album about a woman 's journey through the USA . <sssss> Gasp , how original ! <sssss> To make things worse , all of the songs sound the same ! <sssss> Tori 's production adds nothing new and she is clearly running out of song-writing and production ideas . <sssss> There are some bright spots , however . <sssss> The albums first single , " A Sorta Fairytale " , is a lovely , if not overlong song . <sssss> " Carbon " is also quite nice , but it also sounds like most everything she 's ever done . <sssss> " Your Cloud " , " Virginia " , " Wednesday " , and " Taxi Ride " are also good , but offer nothing new . <sssss> Tori Amos seems quite content to release albums when she clearly has dried up every idea in her . <sssss> I hope Tori will take a long , long break and then come out with an album that will be refreshing and original .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00006I4YD	5	After over ten years of recording albums , Tori was finally able to match her the achievement of her musical debut , ' Little Earthquakes . <sssss> ' ' Scarlet 's Walk ' does just that : she 's back , after a not-so-brilliant ' Strange Little Girls ' made up of versions in 2001 , with an album for posterity , what could be a considered an album for the road and one that you ca n't take out of the CD player once you pop it in . <sssss> The first couple of songs ( " Amber Waves " and " A Sorta Fairytale " ) set the stage for what 's left down the road ... " Carbon " and " Crazy " take things up a notch , making you beg for more . <sssss> But the true best lies toward the end : in " I Ca n't See New York " she reminds of Kate Bush more often than not . <sssss> The strength of her Bosendorfer is coupled with Matt Chamberlain 's exquisite bass and an impeccable drums work to yield a song for the ages . <sssss> The great music does n't stop . <sssss> It 's all " downhill " in a spiral of amazing tracks back-to-back after # 12 , to top it all with the closing " Gold Dust " , in my opinion , one of the best pieces of music and lyrics Tori has ever composed . <sssss> Thanks for it all , Tori . <sssss> You brought life back into the void that no one else has been able to fill !
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00006I4YD	5	i was a big tori fan going into this record , and now i am officially obsessed with tori ; the album is just that good . <sssss> this album is like a potpourri of all the stylings of her other albums combined into one . <sssss> i can see alot of boys for pele influence on here as well as some upbeat poppy stuff of the likings of from the choirgirl hotel . <sssss> every song is a standout on this CD and may sound the same when you give it a first listen , but it gets so much better as time goes on . <sssss> every song is filled with tori 's beautiful piano hooks , and at 70 minute plus music , its irresistible . <sssss> it is my number 2 album of the year , number one being cee-lo . <sssss> But you need this album ... . <sssss> i really hope a sorta fairytale can make it on top 40 radio because it seems to be crawling there at the moment . <sssss> i really believe taxi ride could be a huge hit if released as a single !
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B00006I4YD	4	After last year 's strange and IMHO disappointing " detour " with the covers-only Strange Little Girls CD , Tori storms back to form with " Scarlet 's Walk " . <sssss> Ok , it 's a concept album ( which concept , frankly , is hard to make out , and the Amazon editorial review strangely focues on , to the exclusion of the music ) . <sssss> I 'd rather focus on the music : are these good songs ? <sssss> The answer is an unequivocal YES . <sssss> The overall sound of the album is a mix of " Venus Orbitting " ( the studio side of " To Venus and Back " ) and " Under the Pink " . <sssss> Among the 18 songs , there are many highlights . <sssss> One of the things of Tori 's nowadays sound that gets not enough credit is the amazing work from bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain , both among the top-echelon in their respective crafts : " Sweet Sangria " and " Pancake " demonstrate that so well . <sssss> ( In concert Tori Amos works as a trio , with just Jon and Matt , yet creating an amazing " wall of sound " on the harder songs . <sssss> ) What keeps this from getting a 5 star rating is that " Scarlet 's Walk " is , at 74 min . <sssss> , simply too long . <sssss> Musically , there are about 4 or 5 filler songs that could have been deleted and made the album much tighter . <sssss> In all , this is a most welcome return of Tori after last year 's disappointing cover-album .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00006I4YD	5	Amos venture to new sounds in her last three albums , where well receive and admire , but with her new label Epic this album , she goes back to a familiar sound " a-la-Under the Pink " , this album will satisfied any Amos fan in every aspect , it conserves her approach of music with wicked lyrics and double minded intentions . <sssss> The more settle music of " Scarlet ' ws Walk " it 's a group of tunes that saw the life by specific livings in a USA travel trip . <sssss> Great voice , great music , great talent , enchanting stories , a worth record to own .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B000089RVR	5	I loved Dido 's first CD , and I did n't know if she had it in her to make a terrific sophomore album . <sssss> Well , Dido proves here that she has the talent to stick around for years to come . <sssss> Every song works here . <sssss> The best thing about Dido is that her songs are deceptively simple . <sssss> She tackles some pretty dark themes , and you do n't really notice that until you listen to the album over and over . <sssss> " White Flag " was a great choice for a first single . <sssss> It shows that Dido is one of those artists who is able to sing about her shortcomings in a relationship rather than blaming someone else . <sssss> There are so many good songs here , and it is for that reason alone I think you should buy this album . <sssss> Dido is here to stay , and it 'd be too bad if you did n't pick up this very good album .1 ) White Flag : a really good song .2 ) Stoned : I love the beat .3 ) Life for Rent : I love the meaning behind the song .4 ) Mary 's in India : a great showcase for her voice . <sssss> The ending is a little surprising .5 ) See You When You 're 40 : another really cool song .6 ) Do n't Leave Home : one of my favorites .7 ) Who Makes You Feel : I love the way her voices builds on this song . <sssss> The beat is cool too .8 ) Sand in my Shoes : you can tell she really feels this song . <sssss> It 's very good .9 ) Do You Have a Little Time : another good song .10 ) This Land is Mine : another good showcase for her voice .11 ) See the Sun : this song is a great way to end the album . <sssss> Very uplifting and terrific . <sssss> One of my favorites . <sssss> HIDDEN TRACK : a really good , simple song . <sssss> It takes a while to start , so do n't turn off your CD player . <sssss> This is a really good CD . <sssss> I highly recommend it .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B000089RVR	3	If you 're looking for this album to be " No Angel " part 2 you 're in for a big surprise . <sssss> Although she 's kept her style the music in " Life for Rent " is more mellow . <sssss> I consider this album to be very slow . <sssss> The songs that I like are : White Flag , Stoned , Life for Rent , Sand in my Shoes , See the Sun and Do n't leave home ( this being my favorite along with White Flag ) . <sssss> The rest of the songs are pretty slow . <sssss> Good album , but the first one was a little more energetic .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B000089RVR	4	I remember watching one of those audio-based music stations on TV a few months ago , and at one point " White Flag " , the new single from Dido , came on . <sssss> And I said , " It 's about TIME " ! <sssss> I had been waiting for Dido to bring some new stuff to the table , and she did just that with Life For Rent . <sssss> As usual , the lyrics are handled by Dido and her brother , with select producers grabbing the pen here and there . <sssss> And good tracks come out of all this , like " Do You Have A Little Time " and " Sand In My Shoes " . <sssss> The hidden bonus track also shows outstanding results . <sssss> Dido 's soft voice is still here , and it 's good for painting pictures like " See You When You 're 40 " , and the interesting story " Mary 's In India " . <sssss> But the subjects do n't always stay positive , as proven by the feel-sorry-for-yourself title track . <sssss> And " See the Sun " is soul-satisfying , and it may be even heart-wrenching if you or someone you know is going through a tragedy and needs to hear some words of encouragement . <sssss> There are only two songs on here I could do without . <sssss> " Do n't Leave Home " gets the message across , but those lyrics are n't the best , and I just could n't get into " Stoned " . <sssss> But this is still a great sophomore effort from Dido . <sssss> Pick it up . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B000089RVR	4	Though a very solid effort in its ' own right , Dido 's NO ANGEL did n't hit big until Eminem sampled her " Thank You " for his track " Stan " . <sssss> Fortunately , superstar assistance is not needed for LIFE FOR RENT , which not only outpaces NO ANGEL on an artistic level , but will hopefully prove Dido to be no one trick pony . <sssss> Indeed , first track " White Flag " is easily her best single to date -- and it 's not even the best track on the album . <sssss> That would be the electronic-laden " Stoned " , though it 's followed very closely by the title track and " Do n't Leave Home " , all of which have not only gloriously hook-filled melodies but first-rate lyrical content . <sssss> The rest of the set is lyrically strong , though lacking the immediacy of the aforementioned tracks . <sssss> In the end , I would never have thought that this would turn out to be one of the best pop records of the year -- shows what I know .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B000089RVR	4	I have never bought a Dido album , ever . <sssss> I liked all of her singles off " No Angel " and I thought " White Flag " Was OK , but I really loved the song " Life For Rent " , and the other day ( well yesterday ! <sssss> ) I was looking around and saw 3 Dido " Life For Rent " Album Casettes there for $ 6.99 , I thought It 's cheap , my friend says its good , might as well buy it . <sssss> I never had an intention to buy this EVER ! <sssss> , I was pleasantly surprised by some of the up-beat songs and beautiful lyrics . <sssss> I never knew she was sooooo out there such as the songs " Stoned " , with the odd lyics " When your ' e stoned baby / And I am drunk / And we make love / It seems a little desolate / " RRRRigght ! <sssss> and the lyics for a song I can not remember " I dont touch you the way I used to / " OK , but none the less , I love this album and would reccomend it to anyone who is thinking of purchasing it !
A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	B000089RVR	5	Than do yourself a favor and listen to this ! <sssss> Dido 's second album has personally been a long time coming for me . <sssss> Her radio hit " Here With Me " did n't really catch on until a year after ' No Angel ' was released . <sssss> The show Rosewell pretty much launched her career but I 've been a fan since her debut was first released close to 3 years ago so it 's a breath of fresh air to hear the new material found on ' Life For Rent ' . <sssss> This CD took a while to grow on me but I 'm hardly disappointed . <sssss> At this present moment I ca n't really say I like this more than her previous work but I find myself enjoying this on a deeper level every chance I get to press play and have a feeling I eventually will . <sssss> This sounds less commercial and more original . <sssss> She seems to have found her niche and all has been improved . <sssss> The inclusion of orchestral strings adds a nice touch to songs like " White Flag " and " See The Sun " and I love her exploration for electronica on " Stoned " . <sssss> You can also hear traces of Faithless on tracks like " Who Makes You Feel " and " Sand In My Shoes " , which should come as no surprise since a couple members from that group contribute to this album , including her brother , Rollo Armstrong . <sssss> " Do You Have a Little Time " , " This Land Is Mine " and " Do n't Leave Home " are my very favorites though . <sssss> Her gorgeous voice is always clear in pronunciation and she never strains herself . <sssss> Instead she sings naturally and lets the emotions flow out of her . <sssss> Screaming at the top of your lungs is not the key element to being a good , talented artist and Dido is the perfect example of that .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B000089RVR	5	" Life For Rent " is Dido 's follow-up album of " No Angel " . <sssss> She combines pop , synthesizer , and celtic to create a highly unique sound that pleases audiences . <sssss> Such musical quality raises her level from her previous efforts . <sssss> Her lyrics are written and performed beautifully regardless if she 's singing about love , loneliness , or intimacy . <sssss> Her voice offers a shy , yet deep glimpse into her words and personal life . <sssss> Whether she 's singing with an upbeat or a ballad tempo , she remains flawless . <sssss> She offers a wonderful variety of musical flavors throughout the album . <sssss> Her Grammy-nominated hit single " White Flag " is a great way to begin this musical journey , which expresses her pop background . <sssss> This introduces what 's to come throughout the remainder . <sssss> Her signature musical combination sometimes adds other musical elements , making her tracks more interesting . <sssss> " Stoned " stands out the most in such experimentation , adding eerie and techno elements . <sssss> Her ballads offer an orchestrated theme , making her words deeper and more meaningful . <sssss> With most of mainstream music sounding the same , it 's great that Dido continues doing her own thing . <sssss> Radio needs more like her . <sssss> " Life For Rent " is a great album for those looking for unique music . <sssss> This will become an unforgettable experience for many and in some cases , addictive . <sssss> Dido is expected to receive some 2004 Grammy nominations , including Best Pop Album and possibly Album of the Year , which are highly deserved .
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B000089RVR	3	I admit , Dido 's music takes me a long time to warm up to . <sssss> It was months after I 'd heard her debut record that I finally started liking it . <sssss> For the moment , Life for Rent sounds like a good effort to me , but one which is a little too content to stay in the moody , polite spectrum of music . <sssss> Even on No Angel , the tracks I loved the most were the more ferocious rock / dance tracks which contrasted Dido 's whispery , restrained voice against a muscular musical backdrop -- " Hunter " and the Youth-produced rhythmic monster " Do n't Think of Me " being the best examples . <sssss> There is no such track here . <sssss> Dido 's lyrics have improved greatly , the emotional exposes of " White Flag " and " Life for Rent " being expressive far beyond the levels of any song on " No Angel " . <sssss> There is also no Hallmark card sentiment here akin to " Thank You " from No Angel . <sssss> However , this record does need contrasting elements , shades , and quite simply , uptempo tunes to vary the pacing and enhance the effect when the slow tracks * do * come in . <sssss> Dido music has been called " coffeehouse " by some , and I think she should look into bringing in some new blood into her collaborative circle . <sssss> Her music * is * on the verge of becoming easy listening , and she 's proved that she is capable of more .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000089RVR	3	Dido 's eponomyous debut No Angel took a while before it set the charts on fire and everyone started hailing her as a trip-hop chanteuse . <sssss> But while No ANgel was largely enjoyable , it had much to thank for due to Thank You and Here With Me . <sssss> The rest of the album sounded pretty similar . <sssss> Come 2003 , she 's back with Life For Rent . <sssss> First single , White Flag follows in the vein of Here With Me . <sssss> The single sets the direction for the CD . <sssss> Dido takes no risk on Life For Rent but rehashes the successful formula that made her a star in the first place . <sssss> White Flag is enjoyable by most standards , better than most radio fodder out there these days . <sssss> A good beat , a catchy chorus and haunting vocals - all the right ingredients for a Dido smash . <sssss> But elsewhere on the album , the true gems are the title track and the near-closer See The Sun . <sssss> If you like No Angel Part 2 , grab this album . <sssss> If not , replay No ANgel .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B000089RVR	4	While she is no Sarah McLaughlin , British export Dido does a pretty good job of trying to come close . <sssss> On her new album , " Life For Rent " , she continues her introspective standard . <sssss> This cd seems to be a little more upbeat than her first release , " No Angel " . <sssss> There are several radio-friendly tracks here ... . <sssss> especially the current single " White Flag " , " See The Sun " , " Sand In My Shoes " , and " Do n't Leave Home " . <sssss> " Do n't Leave Home " tends to be my favorite . <sssss> Her voice sounds really great on this track and the music is loud enough to give her a good backing sound . <sssss> Apart from the main tracklisting , there is an extra bonus song embedded behind " See The Sun " ... . <sssss> so make sure to keep playing after that one is over ! <sssss> If the radio does n't tire us of Dido as they did with the few singles from " No Angel " , I think people will really appreciate this album ... . <sssss> and will play it on those rainy days when they good chill-out music to match the dreary mood .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000089RVR	4	This album really grew on me , and now I love it . <sssss> The first single really caught my attention with it 's honesty . <sssss> That of course is the wonderful song " White Flag " . <sssss> I knew I had to have the CD . <sssss> I actually like this one more than NO ANGEL , I just find I connect with the meaning and depth of this album more than her first one . <sssss> The songs have a charismatic way of entering my head and staying there . <sssss> The album did n't blow me away at first , but with each listen I find more I love about it . <sssss> I can honestly say I like all of the songs on here . <sssss> They have so far picked great singles . <sssss> The title track is a very relatable song , a nice ballad with a moving chorus and melody . <sssss> " Do n't Leave Home " is my favorite though , a moving ballad of devotion . <sssss> The video was very interesting and cool too . <sssss> " Sand In My Shoes " is a nice song with a cool chorus that will stay with you . <sssss> " Stoned " is an interesting song with an electronica edge ( most of the songs here have elements of electronica mixed with pop ) and some interesting lyrics . <sssss> " Mary 's In India " was not a favorite , but it grew on me . <sssss> " See You When You 're 40 " is a great breakup song , and should be a single . <sssss> Other highlights include " This Land Is Mine " , " See The Sun " , and " Who Makes You Feel " . <sssss> I was n't disapointed at all .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B000089RVR	4	Dido is n't an artist who sounds terribly original . <sssss> She has strong links to any female artist who have come before her such as Kate Bush , Annie Lennox , Laurie Anderson , Tori Amos , Jewel , Alanis Morissette , Sophie B. Hawkins , Joan Osborne and , of course , Sarah McLachlan and Loreena McKennitt . <sssss> However , she does have her own vision of how relationships are , and like " No Angel " , " Life For Rent " continues to explore themes of broken and unattained relationships . <sssss> Dido also has a gifted vocal quality that makes her sound both depressed and angelic AND uplifting all in one . <sssss> All the tracks compliment one another and no one particular track detracts from the flow of the cd . <sssss> There are brilliant moments on the disc such as the chorus to " Life For Rent " , the lyrics to " See You When You 're 40 " , the idea to turn in a more r & b flavored track on " Who Makes You Feel " and the meter and rhythm of " Sand In My Shoes " . <sssss> " White Flag " , " Mary 's In India " and " See The Sun " are all solid failed relationship songs that sound honest and true ( which is what I want from an artist because the song does n't feel disposable ) . <sssss> I certainly enjoyed " Life For Rent " more than " No Angel " and Dido avoided the sophomore slump with ease . <sssss> This is the type of cd I can listen to anytime , and I look forward to hearing future cds from Dido .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000089RVR	4	This is an album that has grown on me a little more with each listen . <sssss> At first , only a few songs stood out . <sssss> With time , others seeped their way into my brain and became favorites . <sssss> The lead single " White Flag " is my favorite song . <sssss> Maybe cliche , but the song is great and vocally she sounds excellent , not to mention it has a great hook and overall is an incredible pop song that is very memorable . <sssss> I like the song " Do n't Leave Home " as well , there is a warmth to her vocals that gives depth to the song ( and others ) . <sssss> The title track is a nice confessional ballad . <sssss> " Stoned " is another favorite , it has an electronica flair , it definately grew on me a lot . <sssss> Other favorites include " See You When You 're 40 " , " Who Makes You Feel " , " This Land Is Mine " , and " Do You Have A Little Time " .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B000089RVR	3	Dido 's second album is very nice , the hit songs a wonderful , emotional and very well written . <sssss> Dido 's a song writer of high class , rare poetical lyrics that will be hard to find from the average artist , sometimes however i feel like the lyrics are better then the songs itself . <sssss> I did n't know if i should give a 2 or 3 , 2 ' 5 would be better suited perhaps . <sssss> " White flag " and " Life for rent " are songs you simply can not dislike , when you 've heard them a few times they 're stuck on you . <sssss> " Do n't leave home " is the 3th really good song on this album , slow emotional and well written . <sssss> " Stones " a trip hop song , after all she had a past with Faithless . <sssss> A decent song , probably a upcoming single . <sssss> The other songs are passable though , almost all of them slow and simular , good lyrics but not so interesting . <sssss> A decent album .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B000089RVR	5	At times , Dido is compared with other artists such as Annie Lennox ( whose latest production is also brilliant , by the way ) , Natalie Merchant and even Tori Amos . <sssss> The sole comparison should be a source of pride for her , given the musical stature of all of these names , but the truth is that slowly , with only two albums out , she 's carving her place in today 's musical scene as one of the most talented & balanced acts out there . <sssss> Three years after her successful debut album , " No Angel " , Dido Armstrong comes back stronger sharing again producing and writing duties with her brother Rollo ( from Faithless ) . <sssss> The product of their collaboration is a more solid album than the previous one . <sssss> Doing a song per song account of the album would be a waste of your time , mainly because it all stands out as a cohesive piece of work , with great lyrics that sit close to your heart of mine ( I mean , you have to be able to relate on an emotional or intellectual level to the lyrics of at least some of the songs ) , and though some people contend that most songs sound " the same " , I 'd argue that the musical production also shows an evolution beyond her first album , with songs like " Stoned " , " Mary 's in India " , " See you when you 're 40 " and " Do n't leave home " as a testimony of this . <sssss> All in all , Dido came back to stay and it sure comes in at a great time when there 's a need for more talented artists like her in the pop scene .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B000089RVR	2	I was so excited to pick up this CD , after hearing her debut No Angel ... after listening I left wondering " What Happened " ? <sssss> I really love Dido 's voice , but the material on this album is dreadful - that 's right , dreadful !! <sssss> I listened to White Flag and thought , ehhh ... this is ok ... then I realized this was her first single from this album and then thought ... <sssss> Uh Oh . <sssss> My fears came true as I listened on . <sssss> This disc has no spirit . <sssss> Listen closely to her vocals throughout the whole CD - it 's nearly monotone . <sssss> Sad to say , I really did n't have any favorites on this disc and will probably let it sit in my CD collection , unlistened to , or sell it. <sssss> I do have one question though , " Dido , did you do this or did Arista records do this " ? 
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B000089RVR	5	" No Angel " was a wonderful album of mellowed out sad love-songs , but " Life For Rent " ventures into deeper territory . <sssss> Dido 's beautiful voice compliments the tri-beats and beautiful melodies that infect the album with an unshakeable dreary lovelyness . <sssss> Gorgeous songs such as " White Flag " , " Sand in My Shoes " , and the unstoppable " Life For Rent " make the album a must have for any serious music lover .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00008J4P5	3	The White Stripes are actually one of my favorite bands . <sssss> I already own and enjoy their first three albums , so when I heard that they were releasing a new one , of course I raced out to get it . <sssss> Unfortunately ( and people may not want to admit this ) , this album is n't without its problems . <sssss> Things start off with a bang , though , with the leadoff single " Seven Nation Army " . <sssss> " I Just Do n't Know What To Do With Myself " is great too . <sssss> But the most innovative song would have to be " Ball And Biscuit " due to its spoken-word flow . <sssss> And " In The Cold , Cold Night " was refreshing too because Meg was actually leading a song ! <sssss> Sadly , being innovative does n't always prove successful , as especially evidenced by the disorganized sounds of " Black Math " ; and sorry , but I just could n't get into " Well It 's True That We Love One Another " . <sssss> Also , I had to stop a few times to make sure I was , in fact , listening to Elephant and not White Blood Cells because of certain similarities . <sssss> " There 's No Home For You Here " sounds a little like " Dead Leaves And The Dirty Ground " , and when I heard " Hypnotize " , I said , " I remember when this song used to be called ` Fell In Love With A Girl ' " . <sssss> One more thing I have to mention is the obligatory song that 'll make you ask , " Was Meg even there " ? <sssss> This time around , that song is " You 've Got Her In Your Pocket " . <sssss> The song is still good , though . <sssss> In short , if you 're a diehard fan of The White Stripes ( like I am ) , you 'll still feel like keeping Elephant in your collection , but you ca n't help but to feel a little disappointed . <sssss> At least they can still blow you away when you see them performing live .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B00008J4P5	3	Elephant ~ The White Stripes is a totally alright album . <sssss> The sound is the typical garage sound and the lyrics are likewise . <sssss> The singer sounds awful and his vocal skills are quite limited . <sssss> To be honest , I had never heard of this band before and I did not have any high hopes for this album so to say that I am disappointed would be a lie . <sssss> The book-let is really nice with cool photos and informative liner notes . <sssss> Still I have no idea what they are singing about and the little " story " inside the book-let does not make any sense . <sssss> This is an ok album that could have been better .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B00008J4P5	2	These two pale-faced slugs continue to fake out the world of rock and roll by posing as a singer / drummer combo . <sssss> Truth be told , there 's no way in heck these lazy sods could churn out the unfiltered noise they do without lots of help . <sssss> What they do n't tell you is that Jack and Kate White ( otherwise known as Jack and Kate Ryan ) have a bassist and keyboardist with them at all times in the studio and in concert . <sssss> Plus , Kate White does n't play her own drums , due to the fact that she can barely play . <sssss> Jack White lip syncs in concert , and rumor has it this weird combo used to play metal ballads at weddings in New Jersey , where they floundered severely and almost called it quits . <sssss> They were discovered , though , by some alterna-dude who thought he could mold them into a band like the Black Keys . <sssss> Next thing you know , these two posers called themselves White Stripes and turned " alternative " , and everybody 's feeding off them now as if they were Bon Jovi in the '80s . <sssss> Every rumor you 've heard about this duo is true , but there 's also a lot you do n't get to hear about them . <sssss> Steer clear from this wreckage of an album . <sssss> I heard it a few times at a high-profile book store that specializes in alternative music and was highly turned off by the repetative drudgery of its sound . <sssss> GOOD DAY !!!!!!!!!!! 
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B00008J4P5	5	" Elephant " is one of the best garage rock albums to be released since the genre became popular . <sssss> Its unique melodies allow Jack White to further sing his true feelings . <sssss> He plays most of the instruments on the album , except the drums , played by his sister Meg White . <sssss> He writes , produces , and arranges the songs , sharing his prized ideas . <sssss> Though most tracks omit the bass guitar , the heavy guitar sound fills in brilliantly . <sssss> The light but heavy rock sound gives the listener a one-on-one sensation ( you 'll have to listen to know what I mean by " light but heavy " ) . <sssss> " Seven Nation Army " opens this album with its bass themes sound , allowing the audience to listen closer to the rest of it . <sssss> The other tracks experiment with 70 's hard rock and punk rock from all decades . <sssss> They prove with this combination that they are one of the most unique musical acts of today , and that they will be around for many more years . <sssss> They allow the audience to escape from the sell-out fake pop sound often played on the radio . <sssss> Those who love this album will also love their previous album " White Blood Cells " . <sssss> *** Their Grammy nominations are coming !!!!! 
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B00008J4P5	4	Not being a big fan of low-fi garage rock , or Jack White 's singing voice , I thought The White Stripes ' last album was overrated . <sssss> I bought Elephant with reservations and was delighted to find a much stronger , groovier , and more musical album that retains the punk attitude of White Blood Cells but ups the songwriting , production and performance ante . <sssss> Jack White 's frequently offkey , whiny singing sounds more polished on this record , doing much more singing than shouting , and it 's a welcome change . <sssss> His voice is still more about attitude and urgency than body or finesse , but it just sounds so much better on Elephant . <sssss> But it 's the songwriting and arrangement that really make this record shine : The positively primordial riff to " Seven Nation Army " stuck to my head for days , the ' Black Sabbath Vol . <sssss> 4 ' guitar sludge of " Black Math " is aggressive and rocks out like a maniac , the cover of " I Just Do n't Know What to Do with Myself " outdoes Elvis Costello 's version thanks to an unusually sensitive and soulful Jack White lead vocal , and " Ball and Biscuit " taps into the deep grooves of the best classic-rock bands . <sssss> There 's a heavy Stones / Zeppelin vibe to this record that 's highly suitable to the ragged soul of The White Stripes , hitting that groove which only blues and blues-based rock can muster . <sssss> A great record for the year , showing major progression for this band .
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I	B00008J4P5	4	I ca n't believe I waited so long to get this album , it 's at least as good as " White Blood Cells " . <sssss> I imagine anyone who remotely liked that would this as well . <sssss> As fresh and original as it sounds , it also feels like it could have been done in 1970 , whether it 's similar to " The Stooges " , or " The Mama 's And Papa 's " . <sssss> The only hits here are " Seven Nation Army " and " The Hardest Button To Button " , both easy to like . <sssss> However I like others just as much . <sssss> " Ball And Biscuit " and " Girl , You Have No Faith In Medicine " are great , and " The Air Near My Fingers " is sweet too . <sssss> Meg sings on " In The Cold , Cold Night " and the cool last track , and sounds just as cute as she looks . <sssss> Overall it 's an excellent album , and the two of them have now earned their " Stripes " .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00008J4P5	4	In a similar line as contemporary acts The Vines and The Hives , this somewhat post-punk sounding duo comes with a very interesting proposal : a down-to-earth , forget-all-you 've - heard-about-production , do n't - polish-the-edges-type sound . <sssss> For the fourth album by Jack and Meg White , it could be dismissed as a poorly produced album , but beware : there 's more behind their work than jumps up right away . <sssss> I had the opportunity to see to the guitar-drum duo live last night in Conan , and they were very impressive . <sssss> In fact , Jack White ( guitar ) brought back memories of Jeff Buckley in more than one sense : the passion , his voice almost ripping his throat . <sssss> This is an act to keep an eye on . <sssss> The best of this recent wave of bands driven by the same inspiration and frustration that brought the punk and grunge movements to life .
A97B72F4UI8FA	B00008J4P5	5	So , how do you follow up a platinum breakthrough album , arguably the biggest break through of 2002 ? <sssss> With " Elephant " , of course , and nothing else . <sssss> This album is not only the best White Stripes albums ( yes i have all four ) but their most ambitious , intricate , and fun albums to date . <sssss> Instead of one sound on the album , ( such as the self titled debut , where its mostly hard riffed " organized noise " , or de stijl , with mostly soft , melodic pop / rock music white-stripes style ) this one balances it all out . <sssss> Ball and Biscuit has to be the best part of the whole CD , as no other artist would have the balls ( haha no pun intended ) to put something liek this out . <sssss> This album sounded like it came straight from 30 years ago , more so than any of their other albums . <sssss> They recorded it in a studio predating the beatles - and you can tell . <sssss> no wonder critics like it - this album is liek taking a journey back in time . <sssss> This album is going to be on every single critic 's top-10 lists this year , and i will be very happy and stunned if their is an album that comes close this year . <sssss> " The Headphoen Masterpiece " by Cody ChesnuTT comes close , but nothing can beat this album so far in terms of quality , ambition , and overall achievement in this album .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B00008J4P5	5	What a classic . <sssss> Superior to every rock release of the year . <sssss> This cd is my introduction to the white stripes . <sssss> I 'd heard ` Seven nation army ' and read tonnes of fantastic reviews and this made me curious . <sssss> Recorded with just old ` real ' instruments , no computers or synths , the result is amazing . <sssss> The stomping ` Seven nation army ' is brilliant . <sssss> Meg White takes a turn on vocals for the tender ` In the cold cold night ' . <sssss> The remake of ' I just do n't know what to do with myself ' with it 's gentle / rocky treatment is wonderful . <sssss> The punk rock of ` Hypnotize ' does just that . <sssss> Other standouts include ` The air near my fingers ' , the blues of ' Ball and biscuit ' , ` The hardest button to button ' , and ` It 's true that we love one another ' which sounds like it was recorded during a visit to a London pub. <sssss> A brilliant cd . <sssss> Hard to see how Meg and Jack can surpass this , but I 'm sure they will .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B00008J4P5	4	To say that I did not like " White Blood Cells " would be an understatement . <sssss> Yes , there were a couple of songs that I liked , including of course " Fell in Love With a Girl " , but overall I thought that album was a bunch of noise without much melody or warmth . <sssss> Switch to " Elephant " . <sssss> Of course I had heard the single " Seven Nation Army " , which I liked . <sssss> For Christmas my 14 yr . <sssss> old daughter had " Elephant " on her wish-list , so I got it for her . <sssss> And of course I listened to it as well . <sssss> Much to my surprise , I liked what I was hearing ! <sssss> Over the last couple of months , I have to come to actually like this album , a lot . <sssss> " Elephant " ( 14 tracks , 50 min . <sssss> ) still is touch-and-go for me , but there are more than enough highlights . <sssss> " Black Math " is my favorite track , period , it just rocks beyond belief . <sssss> " In the Cold Cold Night " finds Meg on vocals , and quite effectively . <sssss> The monster track is " Ball and Biscuit " , an epic song that finds Jack whipping out heavy guitar solos , just great . <sssss> Other highlights include " Little Alcorns " and the short ( less than 2 min . <sssss> ) " Hypnotize " , a surf-rocker as good as you 'll find . <sssss> Meg 's drumming , a hot topic , is quite good throughout the album . <sssss> So almost a year after this album came out , I finally " get it " . <sssss> " Elephant " in my opinion is a quantum leap from " White Blood Cells " as it shows the 2 person band actually sounding as a full band , with songs that have melodies . <sssss> Ca n't wait what the next White Stripes album will bring .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B00008J4P5	5	The White Stripes are brilliant for what they do n't do , deliver overproduced , pretentious , bloated and boring 79 minute epic CD 's that are more filler than actual music . <sssss> The raw energy and enthusiasm Jack and Meg bring to these 14 cuts is positively infectious and " Elephant " is likely to be the best rock album you 'll hear all year . <sssss> When the guitar kicks in full volume and Meg 's snare and crash cymbals starts bashing out on the first chorus of " Seven Nation Army " you are so invigorated is almost makes you cry , and the Zeppelin-ish , droning , distorted bridge on " Black Math " is heavier metal than most so called thrash bands can muster in an entire career . <sssss> Simplicity is the key here ; The Stripes have a simple patented formula and know how to work it to stunning effect . <sssss> Meg sings , but does n't butcher " In the Cold Cold Night " and lends the song an air of seduction that would be lost in lesser hands . <sssss> Jack does his best Mark Bolan impression on quite a few of these tracks , but finds his true soul-shouter within and it never comes across as mere mimickry . <sssss> The White Stripes have offically claimed their place in the annals of rock history . <sssss> We 'll be hearing " Elephant " forever .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00008OWZE	4	There 's gon na be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album ! <sssss> The most important thing is to keep an open mind . <sssss> Indeed , Jewel has traded in her acoustic guitar for a new dance floor sound . <sssss> Indeed , she looks like an 80 's Cyndi Lauper on the cd cover . <sssss> Yet , the biggest thing Jewel has NOT done is sell out . <sssss> She may look and sound different , but Jewel has remained true to her heart . <sssss> She has proven that one does n't need an acoustic guitar to make meaningful music . <sssss> At the same time , she proves that rhythmic music can be very meaningful as well . <sssss> Anyone who has listened to the lyrics of ' Intuition ' carefully has already figured this out . <sssss> Jewel is mocking commercialism and materialism ! <sssss> Or , making political and societal statements ( if you will ) . <sssss> Is this really so different from what she has done in the past ? <sssss> The ' Intuition ' video is the biggest mockery of all ! <sssss> The video displays Jewel : The Actress . <sssss> The songs ' U & Me = Love ' and ' 2 Become 1 ' follow , lyrically , in the tradition of Jewel 's 1996 mega hit ' You were meant for me . <sssss> ' ' America ' is yet another song where Jewel discusses the many aspects of American society and makes poilitcal statements . <sssss> Gosh , this sounds like the same girl to me ! <sssss> Although , despite keeping her lyrics true to heart , the dance beats heard throughout make this cd Jewel 's most fun project to date . <sssss> Heck , it 's dance music ! <sssss> Meaningful lyrics or not , it 's still fun to listen to ! <sssss> Be sure to listen to the lyrics of each song carefully . <sssss> You 'll discover that Jewel has not , in any way , created fluffy , mindless pop ( which some people are accussing her of doing ) . <sssss> It 's rare to find dance music with a purpose beyond just making people feel energized and relaxed . <sssss> This album proves that the very essence of Jewel will never change ( even though the music has ) .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00008OWZE	4	Jewel 's 0304 is a drastic change from the folk / pop singer we all know and adore . <sssss> This album is not unlistenable like others have stated , it is just very different than her previous records . <sssss> But change is good and well Jewel sure had the guts to try something fun and new . <sssss> Standout tracks include : the gorgeous , Sweet Temptation , the rock-out anthem , America , the sensitive , 2 Find U , and the first single , Intuition . <sssss> Some of the tracks obviously do not measure up like U plus me equals love , very silly and repetitive , Stand is awkward but has cool lyrics , and the closing song Becoming is just plain boring . <sssss> But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel , her writing , and her raspy and lovely voice . <sssss> The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine , Haunted . <sssss> This song is classic Jewel . <sssss> " The fury of my conviction will cause your heart to quicken " . <sssss> Just a haunting song about a man stalking a woman . <sssss> I would give this record a try if you like dance songs , it is a great summer record .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00008OWZE	4	Jewel continues to exist in that very small sector of recording artists who manage to musically better themselves with each new release . <sssss> Dispensing with the folk/pop/country undertones that often distinguish her music , but still lyrically on the same page , 0304 finds the singer beckoning us to the dancefloor . <sssss> Granted , this is n't the out-and-out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for -- it 's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward-thinking remixes of ' Serve The Ego ' that she so effortlessly breezed through . <sssss> But , it is different enough from her previous work to seemingly brandish her a " sell-out " ( othernew members of this club include indie-goddess turned power popster Liz Phair , but that 's for another review ) . <sssss> Which is too bad , because this is indeed Jewel 's best album -- in fact , it 's probably the best album Madonna DID N'T make ( and boy , she REALLY did n't make it with that folk-styled drink coaster otherwise known as AMERICAN LIFE ) . <sssss> First single ' Intuition ' hints at things to come throughout the set , with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez . <sssss> ' Stand ' , ' Fragile Heart ' and the future club smash ' Run 2 U ' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach . <sssss> And even if she falters somewhat by placing identical-sounding songs in slots ten through thirteen , it overall remains a more than solid musical treat .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B00008OWZE	4	Jewel , 0304Jewel has taken a hugely debatable new direction in her music after her last " Yawny " album " THIS WAY " she has sexed up her image , popped up her lyrics and Divad up her voice . <sssss> This album really loves my stereo cuz its so much more interesting to listen to than her other albums , yeah ok " Pieces Of You " was great , especially the beautiful " WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL " ? <sssss> , " FOOLSH GAMES " AND " YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME " , although i must admit the lyrics were super poetic and a tinge boring AFTER THE NON RHYMING LYRICS filled up my head . <sssss> Her second album was a bit better but really no Hit quality , except Hands and Down So Long of course , Then This Way got released and honestly only like 3 songs are really good 4 me , but no real interest . <sssss> Then 0304 comes out and I am very judgemental when this came out , I thought it would suck , but no very good hit factor and super catchy songs , but no real beautiful songs like " Foolish Games " but i love songs like " Intuituion " , " Stand " and " Run 2 U " there are a few more cool tracks but for now , this is my Favourite Jewel album somewhere up there with " Pieces Of You " , hey tons of people wont agree with me but this isnt superpoetic and I guess im a pop person more than a poetry person , I still love her other albums though !
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B00008OWZE	5	Move over Britney , now there 's something meatier - and I mean that in a good , tasteful way !!! <sssss> This album is HOT , plain and simple . <sssss> I heard Jewel 's new and unique " Intuition " on the radio today , and my ears are still trying to adapt !! <sssss> Was that really a hip-hop drumbeat I heard ? <sssss> And is Jewel trying to go the way of Britney , totally cool , totally dance and TOTALLY pop ? <sssss> Looks like it !! <sssss> And I , for one , am enthralled that Jewel is maturing and reaching out to be different . <sssss> Let 's face it , people , this is a pop world , and to not be pop is to not be cool . <sssss> Like the Spice Girls and Madonna of a different age , Jewel is coming to grips with herself and her music through pop , and I , for one ... . <sssss> oops , sorry - I just said that ... Well , as I mentioned before , it takes true courage to be yourself and try a different sound . <sssss> From what I 've heard of this album so far , there 's lots of trip-hop , lots of dance , and totally lots of fun POP !! <sssss> I 'm glad Jewel is no longer an Alaskan hippie , and is instead a girl with a new attitude ! <sssss> You go , girl .... . <sssss> the days of your white van are loooong gone !!! <sssss> SEE YA ' LATER !!!! 
A3I675GA2O8I59	B00008OWZE	5	This is a pleasant departure from her folk rooted sound . <sssss> Her fans will be surprised . <sssss> The combo of songs on this compilation will re-introduce the delicate vocal sound of JEWEL to a new target audience . <sssss> All the compositions from 0304 are lyrically intelligent as all of her prior work , yet the fresh approach in production ( making her sound at times like a reincarnation of WILSON PHILLIPS ) will surely place JEWEL back on the top 40 charts . <sssss> " Leave the Lights On " emerges as a song that could become a huge TOP 40 summer hit .
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00008OWZE	4	Jewel is back with a new album and a new look and sound . <sssss> That is the only differences between this Jewel and Jewel of the past . <sssss> The introspective songwriting is still here , it 's just backed with dance beats and a more polished sound that her folk / country stuff from previous albums . <sssss> Yes Jewel has gone pop , but her music still has substance . <sssss> Many accuse her of selling out , but she has n't , this style of music is n't what is all over the place right now . <sssss> The first single " Intution " is a piece of pop heaven , that has proven to be a big hit for her , and people seem to enjoy her new style . <sssss> There 's so many good songs that could be singles like " Stand " , " Run 2 U " , " 2 Find U " , " Fragile Heart " , " Haunted " , etc . <sssss> This is a great album , give it a try and keep an open mind .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00008OWZE	5	Jewel is back with " 0304 " her most successful album to date . <sssss> Debuting at No . <sssss> 2 on Billboards Hot 200 Album Chart , and 4 weeks later still in the Top 20 . <sssss> Is her highest charting album yet . <sssss> With her first single " Intuition " in the Top 30 of Billboards Hot 100 Singles chart - Jewel has made the right career move . <sssss> This album is much more upbeat then her predecessors with " Run 2 U " which I think should be the next single to the upbeat Debbie Gibson-ish pop ditty " Doin ' Fine " to my favorite " Yes U Can " . <sssss> There is still Jewel on this album - however with more beats and rhythm . <sssss> This actually shows off Jewels fabulous voice even better . <sssss> I can honestly see her as the next dance diva . <sssss> However this album is not all dance - but just a great pop confectioners treat . <sssss> Its still in my CD car player after 3 weeks which shows this is a good sign . <sssss> Not a bad song in the bunch , a thorough well produced pop album which shows Jewel can " Sell yourself , Just Cash In " . <sssss> You Go Girl ! <sssss> ... at least you admit it and cashing in with an excellent album at that .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00008OWZE	4	So this is Jewel . <sssss> I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago . <sssss> Slowly but surely " Intuition " grew on me , it 's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism . <sssss> I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music , showing that it is possible . <sssss> It 's not a sell out either , since this music is n't popular like it was a few years ago . <sssss> Not to say it 's bad by any means . <sssss> The best track for me is " 2 Find U " , a nice love song . <sssss> " Run 2 U " is another favorite . <sssss> " Leave The Lights On " has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado . <sssss> " Haunted " is another great track here . <sssss> " 2 Become 1 " is a great love song . <sssss> The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow 's second album , picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics , and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs . <sssss> This is still the same Jewel , just with dance beats . <sssss> And it is her most enjoyable album yet . <sssss> Overall fans might be taken aback but with an open mind , people will be sure to enjoy this CD .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00008OWZE	3	I admit I was among those that were struck as if by a lighting when I saw the video for " Intuition " a while back : " She sold out " ! <sssss> thoughts crossed my mind ... " I 'm so dissapointed " ! <sssss> I thought , until a friend told me I had to really listen to the album , so I just did . <sssss> Though I am not terribly in love with the whole album ( it 's sure more pop than most of her past efforts , and it has no shortage of ' catchy ' tunes ) , the nonconventional lyrics are still there , at times , hiding disguised behind songs with teenage-like names , such as " 2 Find U " . <sssss> The truth is that after the fact , the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with " Intuition " , the song / video that has stigmatized her so much . <sssss> But yes ! <sssss> As a whole , it 's not tough to see that most of the songs are geared toward a more teenage audience , rather than the one that grew through College listening to her earlier work , but there 's a few songs for those of us that are in the latter category , such as the very Alanis-like " Haunted " ( in fact , it 's such an appropriate song to play out loud on a Halloween night like tonight ) and the clever " America " . <sssss> Falling somewhere in between the preferences of the two groups lies the closing track , " Becoming " which I particularly loved . <sssss> All in all , this is an album mostly geared to a teenage audience with a little " classic " Jewel to offer for her longtime followers .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00008OWZE	2	I 've never been that Big on Jewel & sure did n't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set . <sssss> Vocally She is still the same . <sssss> I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now . <sssss> but the Music here & vibe feels like it passed Her by . <sssss> Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound & Vibe just ai n't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance . <sssss> but , Usher style Album titles just ai n't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B00008OWZE	4	I have to agree with the review title from another author , " Jewel as you 've never heard her " ! <sssss> This is true ! <sssss> I was extremely pleased with the light-hearted , yet quality material on this album . <sssss> While listening to the very nicely constructed melodies and lyrics , I found my top tapping and head bobbing . <sssss> This album compels you to move ! <sssss> The strongest songs on the album are : U & Me = Love ( strange title , but excellent ) , America , Becoming , Yes U Can , Sweet Temptation , Haunted and Intuition . <sssss> It seems she really wanted to " cook " on the last half of the album because those songs have the best musical content , lyrically and musically , in my opinion . <sssss> This is a definite buy ! <sssss> Much , much better than her last album , but not quite the caliber of Spirit .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B00008OWZE	5	Jewel is one of my favorite artists , but her kind is easy to fall into the " mainstream " . <sssss> Most people think this album is a reflection of that trend , but they are sadly mistaken . <sssss> 0304 is still the same beautiful melodies with the same haunting , thought-provoking themes that latched millions with " Pieces of You " and " Spirit " . <sssss> The " beats " throw people off , but they have little to do with the messages of the songs . <sssss> " Stand " for example is very reminiscent of " Who Will Save Your Soul " ? <sssss> just with an up-beat tempo . <sssss> " Haunted " sent shivers up my spine , and " America " was a true , shocking song about our national problems . <sssss> No matter how you slice it " 0304 " is a " grade A " album with beautiful lyrics and very good music . <sssss> The public dismissal of it is very disturbing . <sssss> I must wonder if next we will be telling Sarah McLachlan to " take a hike " .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B00008OWZE	3	So I approached Jewel 's " 0304 " album with an open mind , knowing full well that the days of " Who Will Save Your Soul " are long behind us . <sssss> It 's not the out-right " bad " album that I had feared , but it 's also not a " classic " by any stretch of the imagination . <sssss> " 0304 " ( 14 tracks , 53 min . <sssss> ) starts of nicely with " Stand " , with its light-beat dance rhythms . <sssss> " Run 2 U " and " Intuition " follow along the same vein , and then it starts to set it : the songs all sound pretty much the same ! <sssss> Oh no ! <sssss> That 's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long , it all starts sounding the same . <sssss> Admittedly , there are a couple of outstanding tracks : the dramatic ( and non-dance ) " Haunted " , and the name-dropping and culture-referencing " America " . <sssss> Overall , this is an average , somewhat bland album . <sssss> What surprises me is that in the liner notes , Jewel writes that this album is " the first record I enjoy listening to " , which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums . <sssss> It makes me ache for the knock-out punch of " Deep Water / What 's Simple is True / Hands " , from the Spirit album : Jewel was never better .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B00009LI14	5	First of all , if you loved " The Spirit Room " , you 'll love this . <sssss> It 's a great sophomore album where Michelle sounds a bit more hard on a few of the tracks * Are You Happy Now * but it certainly does n't alienate her listening audience . <sssss> Of course , " Are You Happy Now " was the first single and another huge hit for her , but it 's not one of the best tracks . <sssss> Like " Everywhere " on " The Spirit Room " , it grabs your attention , but is n't as good as the other materail on the album . <sssss> The second single " Breathe " is the star of the album . <sssss> It 's the perfect car song with an amazingly catchy chorus . <sssss> It 's sure to be a big hit . <sssss> " Find My Way Back " would make a great third single . <sssss> It 's also very ctachy . <sssss> It shows what a great pop songwriter Michelle is . <sssss> " Tuesday Morning " is the third track that really jumped out at me upon my first listen . <sssss> I love the lyrics and again , it would make a great single . <sssss> Other highlights include " Empty Handed " , " Hotel Paper " , and " It 's You " . <sssss> The whole album is actually a good listen . <sssss> No need to skip tracks on here . <sssss> Michelle is a great singer / songwriter . <sssss> Her material is some of the best music on the radio 2day . <sssss> " Hotel Paper " is highly recommended .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00009LI14	5	Since I first discovered Michelle Branch last year ( like many others ) , her debut cd THE SPIRIT ROOM has been a staple in my cd changer . <sssss> It 's fun , light folk pop with a dose of rock and very enjoyable from top to bottom . <sssss> Thankfully , she has kept that style with HOTEL PAPER ( with a little something new ) . <sssss> Honestly , the worst thing about this cd is it 's title ( which is also a track on the album ) . <sssss> Originally , the title was ONE OF THESE DAYS ) also a track on the album ) . <sssss> The latter would have been a better choice , but Michelle definitely gets ' uniqueness ' points right off the top for her quirky choice . <sssss> After thoroughly enjoying THE SPIRIT ROOM , I was a more than just a little curious about what Michelle would do for her second time out . <sssss> Thankfully , she has n't changed all that much musically . <sssss> Lyrically , she has definitely matured ( something that comes with experience and age ) . <sssss> Of course , her natural talent helps ! <sssss> ' Are you happy now ? <sssss> ' ' Find your way back ' ' Tuesday morning ' ' One of these days ' ' Love me like that ' and ' Where are you now ? <sssss> ' sick with the folk-pop / rock formula that made THE SPIRIT ROOM such a great success . <sssss> ' Breathe ' however , leans more toward hard rock than anything ( different for Michelle , but it sounds great ) . <sssss> While ' Desperately ' ' Hotel paper ' 'Til I get over you ' and ' It 's you ' have a softer , acoustic , country feel to them that begins half way through the album . <sssss> Regardless of the styles , each suits Michelle 's raw , Sheryl Crow-like vocals very well indeed . <sssss> Overall , I say " HOTEL PAPER " is a great buy .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00009LI14	5	Intro - *** Are You Happy Now ( initial single ) - ***** Find Your Way Back - ***** Tuesday Morning - **** Empty Handed - **** One Of These Days - **** Love Me Like That - **** Desperately - ***** Breathe ( second single . <sssss> faired better than the initial ) - **** Where are You Now - ***** Hotel Paper - ***** Till I Get Over You - **** It 's You - ***** Cover Art : B+O ther Art : A-Songwriting : B-Production : A-Length : A+O verall : B -- 56/13 = 4.754.75 stars . <sssss> Oh and IGNORE that , " SO superior to the sophomore album " thing I said about Her first album . <sssss> It was great , but the Scores never Lie ...
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00009LI14	3	Michelle Branch 's Hotel Paper does not stand up next to her debut album , The Spirit Room . <sssss> Nothing is drastically that wrong with Hotel Paper , is just not a well-balanced album . <sssss> Songs i do appreciate include : Are you happy now , Find your way back , empty-handed , love me like that ( deut with Sheryl Crow ) , Breathe , and Hotel Paper . <sssss> The rest of the songs just do n't stick with you , i tried to like these songs but i just could n't . <sssss> Michelle Branch is a great , talented artist but hopefully her next record will move me like her first album . <sssss> It 's a good sophomore effort though .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00009LI14	3	When Michelle Branch first came out with " Everywhere " , I thought her style was pretty decent , but then the music grew on me so much that I bought the album . <sssss> The Spirit Room is one of those albums that you can play all the way through , and you can do the same with this album too - if you 're not paying a lot of attention to it. <sssss> I 'm not saying the album is bad , but the only song that really stands out is the bonus track , " It 's You " . <sssss> The music on the album is great as always , but everything else leaves a little to be desired . <sssss> Michelle wrote all the songs herself again , but sometimes the lyrics are n't the best , especially " 'Til I Get Over You " and the title track . <sssss> Michelle also tends to repeat herself , because " Love Me Like That " ( with Sheryl Crow ) pretty much has her saying the same things she said in " Are You Happy Now " ? <sssss> And speaking of the latter song , I already knew this would n't be a perfect album before I even listened to it because that song sounds just like " All You Wanted " . <sssss> And " Empty Handed " gets a little disorganized at the end . <sssss> Hotel Paper is still worth picking up , but do n't expect another near-classic like her first album . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B00009LI14	3	" Hotel Paper " is to me not as good as " The spirit room " but it still is good to me . <sssss> " Are you happy now " ? <sssss> appeals to alot of people but to me its not my type of song . <sssss> The songs to look out on for this album are " Tuesday Morning " , " Hotel Paper " , " Everywhere " ** and " The Game Of Luv * " . <sssss> See ? <sssss> those r my fave songs but nevertheless good job Michelle but try something a little less " Avril / Norah " next time . <sssss> ** Everywhere is from " The Spirit Room " and is on the NZversion of " Hotel Paper " ** The Game Of Love is from Santana 's Album " Shaman " and is also a single and features on " Hotel Paper " New Zealand version
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B00009LI14	5	Michelle Branch discovers her new , harder edge on her sophmore album " Hotel Paper " than on her previous album " The Spirit Room " . <sssss> She proves on every track that she 's greatly evolved as an artist in a short period of time . <sssss> Production help from John Shanks ( Melissa Etheridge , Stevie Nicks , etc. <sssss> ) offers an additional rock flavor . <sssss> This entire album is based on her break-up with her boyfriend . <sssss> She sings every word emotionally , allowing the listeners to feel them . <sssss> She never loses her quality , regardless if she 's singing with hardcore rock , pop / rock , or ballad themed . <sssss> Such musical range is rare for mainstream rockers . <sssss> Her guitar efforts are also great . <sssss> Her Grammy-nominated hit single " Are You Happy Now " , which is expected to win , is a wonderful song to begin the musical journey , besides the Intro . <sssss> Every detail in this track offers what to come throughout the rest of the album . <sssss> Her duet with Sheryl Crow , a fellow quality rocker , on " Love Me Like That " shows perfect chemistry between them . <sssss> Michelle Branch proves on " Hotel Paper " that she 'll be around for a long time . <sssss> This album guarantees enjoyment to many listeners .
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B00009LI14	3	Michelle Branch belongs in a tradition of pop singers who , by writing their own material , retain a stronger sense of identity and artistic control . <sssss> It 's a good long-term strategy . <sssss> Unfortunately for Branch , her songwriting is in need of some major improvements . <sssss> Branch 's debut The Spirit Room was also an uneven record , with standout tracks like " Everywhere " and " All You Wanted " towering over other songs which seem to drift melodically and feel like filler . <sssss> Hotel Paper 's lead single , " Are You Happy Now " ? <sssss> , features some intriguing melodic turns and a good sing-along chorus that rank among her catchiest tunes ; " Empty Handed " 's moody , bass-driven groove and almost Arabic-sounding octave notes sound seductive and different , a good addition to Branch 's sonic palette . <sssss> But there are weak songs . <sssss> " Find Your Way Back " starts out with a great verse , but the chorus drifts into an unsatisfying slur without resolution ; " Tuesday Morning " is dull , without much build instrumentally or vocally ; and " Desperately " has a good spritely groove , but the melodies meander , once again , becoming repetitive . <sssss> Arrangement is not a strong point on this record . <sssss> This may be the farthest Branch can travel with producer John Shanks , whose production lacks for diversity . <sssss> Unlike Bob Rock , who is a genius at lacing his productions with crisp instrumental hooks that jump out at you ( witness his work on Nina Gordon 's Tonight and the Rest of My Life ) , Shanks is often too content with using the same jangly guitars , bassy throb , and half-machine-half-human rhythms from track to track . <sssss> With a few exceptions , eg . <sssss> the aforementioned " Empty Handed " , the tracks all sound the same with insufficient imagination in the arrangements . <sssss> At her young age , Branch should be proud of her considerable vocal prowess and ambition towards songwriting independence . <sssss> Now is the time for her to hone her songcraft further , in the veins of Nina Gordon and Liz Phair . <sssss> If she can advance her song structures and melodic sense a couple of notches , she could easily become the best of the best .
A3I675GA2O8I59	B00009LI14	4	MICHELLE BRANCH is an artist who is at the forefront of a movement to stream down the sound of pop music . <sssss> Less fluff and more substance . <sssss> MICHELLE 's vocals are placed up front in the mix on her CD " HOTEL PAPER " . <sssss> She demonstrates a natural control in vocal technique that is both instinctive and talented yet not requiring the annoying vocal acrobatics of MARIAH , CELINE and those other outdated divas . <sssss> The song content on this CD is above par for Pop music . <sssss> The tracks " BREATHE " and " TUESDAY MORNING " are perfect examples of great POP music . <sssss> If you 'd like JEWEL with more of an edge , then this is the product for you !
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00009LI14	4	Michele Branch is back with her sophomore effort " Hotel Paper " , which I feel is strong then its predecessor " The Spirit Room " . <sssss> With the first single " Are You Happy Now " ? <sssss> which shows Branchs rock singing chops already rising on Billboards Hot 100 in the Top 40 , and Hotel Paper making an impressive debut at No . <sssss> 2 on the albums Hot 200 Chart shows Branch is here to stay . <sssss> A lot of people disagree with me about Branch that she is a talented singer and writer , ... but she is. <sssss> A very solid album through and through . <sssss> Not a " Rumors " / Fleetwood Mac , but an impressive follow-up that I feel is a stronger , better produced than " The Spirit Room " . <sssss> Branch has some longevity here with " Hotel Paper " which I think will still be on Billboards Top 200 Album chart in the Top 40 a year from now .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B00009LI14	4	Michelle Branch one of many young singers out there , but probably one of the more talented one 's . <sssss> She reminds me of Sheryl Crow , soft rock with good lyrics and hooks . <sssss> Not so much guitars like is some of the heavier rock acts but the good deep and personal lyrics is a good enough reason to buy this . <sssss> I like her voice , it 's strong and emotional and i think she managed to get the attention on every possible song , she simply makes it interesting all of the times . <sssss> Im not into soft rock but i defenitely liked this , so it proves the point that she 's good . <sssss> About the album , some really good songs that will become hit 's but not many super songs that i just say " wow " about after just been listening to them once . <sssss> But in the other hand there are no bad songs on the album either . <sssss> " Are you happy now " the hit song i guess , and among the better one 's too . <sssss> " Find my way back " is strong too and " Breath " which reminds me of " Everywhere " , " Tuesday Morning " should get a mention too , one of the best slow songs on the album , " Hotel Paper " the title track is in a simular style , also good . <sssss> The lyrics however is the most important thing here , she makes strong lyrics that many others can identify themselves with , but also her voice is beautiful to listen too . <sssss> A good album , that will become a summer hit .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B00009LI14	2	When I read the review in Rolling Stone magazine and they gave this album two stars , I thought ( very sarcastically , mind you ) " Yeah , right " . <sssss> Well ... <sssss> I really hate to dog Michelle Branch 's new album , but in all honesty and fairness , it is not very good . <sssss> I ca n't believe how much different this album is that " The Spirit Room " , which is a superb album , absolutely superb . <sssss> What is right with Hotel Paper ? <sssss> One thing : The song Are You Happy Now ? <sssss> What is wrong with Hotel Paper ? <sssss> One : The music and lyrics are far inferior to her " The Spirit Room " release , and below par to the similar artists releasing albums today . <sssss> Two : Where are the catchy melodies , key changes , chord progressions ? <sssss> The songs are very bland and sound like filler or a bunch of B-sides . <sssss> Three : I ca n't believe the duet with Sheryl Crow is as weak as it is ! <sssss> I was so pumped when my CD player hit this song and my frown got bigger and bigger as the minutes played away . <sssss> I really ca n't imagine how a Grammy winner / Grammy nominee could do a duet this bad ? <sssss> I hate to write a critical review like this , but people need to know . <sssss> This is not " The Spirit Room " for sure . <sssss> I 'm not sure there 's any " Spirit " at all ...
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00009LI14	1	What in the world is this ! <sssss> , this album is not close to Spirit Room , what a bad album , only the lead single , but not even that ! <sssss> , i thought a good song like ALL YOU WANTED promised a good sophomore album ! <sssss> but this ! <sssss> I 'm not a music expert but , I do n't like the album , try JEWEL 'S 0304 ( kind of rock meets new wave / pop ) or ANNIE LENNOX " Bare " , even though they 're more pop than this , Hotel Paper is truly not worth buying except if you 're a Michelle Branch Fan !
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00009VRDI	4	With her fairly rushed , and somewhat ordinary , debut disc in 2002 , I wondered if Ashanti was really capable of stepping up and creating a solid , well balanced album ? <sssss> CHAPTER II definitely proves that this ' R&B girl ' is becoming a genuine artist . <sssss> Mind you , I love ' Foolish ' and ' Baby ' ( both of which are sampled briefly on track 9 of CHAPTER II ) and ' Happy ' but 2002 's ASHANTI was a bit plain for the most part . <sssss> Lyrically , CHAPTER II does n't stray too far from the debut album songs ( fortunately , though , totally empty lyrics like those that make up ' Dreams ' on the first LP are nowhere to be seen on CHAPTER II ) . <sssss> Musically , however , the first half of this album takes Ashanti to a new level of artistry and sophistication . <sssss> The reggae flavor and white heat of ' Rock Wit U ' is seducative ear candy and is completely addicting ( seriously , I ca n't stop listening to it !!! <sssss> ) . <sssss> Ashanti also incorporates 60 's + 70 's soul , and even some 80 's style groove ! <sssss> Looks like our little girl is growing up . <sssss> The second half of the album stays pretty much in the same zone that made ' Foolish ' ' Happy ' and ' Baby ' such massive successes ( which is a great thing really ) . <sssss> When a certain formula works , it 's kinda ' foolish ' to abandon it altogether . <sssss> Overall , the two halves that make up this disc creative a balance that will please fans both new and old . <sssss> Vocally , Ashanti also seems to be stronger ( with a considerably better range best heard on track 4 ) . <sssss> Cheers for Ashanti on a successful 2nd album : )
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B00009VRDI	4	Chapter IIis Ashanti 's most daring album in production . <sssss> I think people did n't care for this album that much because of it . <sssss> Some of it is throwback 80 's . <sssss> It 's a bit darker than her debut too . <sssss> She touches on domestic violence on the great single " Rain On Me " . <sssss> I know some of you fans remember that video too ! <sssss> I miss those days of the early 2000 's and the music it brought . <sssss> I must admit when I first heard this CD a couple of times , I only liked the singles and a couple of tracks like " Sweet Baby " featuring Ja Rule . <sssss> But listening to this CD between late May and early June 2012 , I realized how much I love it . <sssss> If it is n't my favorite Ashanti album , it 's definitely tied with her 3rd effort , Concrete Rose . <sssss> There are definitely a couple of weak tracks here , but overall for Ashanti , this is a winner and definitely underrated since it ( like her 3rd effort ) get slammed on repeatedly . <sssss> I really like Ashanti . <sssss> Her vocals are n't super big , but she can sing when she tries . <sssss> Just check all of the tracks on her Murder Inc records with her sister where she tries and proves the haters wrong by belting out either a " Thank You " or in " Sister Stories " on said 3rd effort for example . <sssss> She just does n't generally show that side of her voice on her other songs . <sssss> Anyway , do n't hate . <sssss> Ashanti is here to stay . <sssss> And her new albumBraveHeartwill probably be out in early 2013.4.3 stars . <sssss> DOWNLOAD : " Then Ya Gone " " U Say , I Say " " Carry On " & " I Do n't Mind "
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B00009VRDI	3	This album was supposed to be Ashanti 's transition from hip hop newcomer to diva status , and it worked . <sssss> The follow-up to her downright atrocious self-titled debut is a step in the right direction . <sssss> While anything would have been an improvement , Ashanti really impressed me , going above and beyond what was expected . <sssss> With a clearly wider vocal range , a new look & hot production , Murda Inc 's princess of hip hop soul shows that she is ready to prove her abilities . <sssss> The opening single , " Rock With You " , is radio-friendly hip pop at its finest and will continue to be one of your favorites . <sssss> When compared to her debut 's lead single " Foolish " , you can see how much Ashanti has matured over the past 2 years . <sssss> While the only track worth listening to on her debut was " Baby " , that is definetly not the case on this record . <sssss> She shows shes fed up on " Carry On " as well as touching on her sensitive side with tracks such as " Sweet Baby " & " Rain on Me " . <sssss> The album 's highlight is " The Story of 2 " , an infectious Motown influenced ballad , reminiscent of " Loving You " , the hidden bonus track on Alicia Keys ' debut Songs in a Minor . <sssss> Another standout is " I Found Loving " which reminds me of a 1980 's style smash . <sssss> The album 's biggest disappointment is the ridiculous interludes that do nothing but ruin the flow of the album . <sssss> Ashanti proves that she has the vocal power , the staying power and the diva power to become one of the greatest artists in our generation . <sssss> Her style is sexy without being trashy and she is an excellent role model for young women . <sssss> Once she lost those side-burns she gained a great deal of my respect and she showcased a good deal of talent that she was unfortunatley holding back the first time .
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B00009VRDI	2	The appeal of Ashanti has always escaped me . <sssss> Granted , she 's appeared on some very solid rap collaborations , notably Fat Joe 's highly addictive ' What 's Luv ? <sssss> ' , but her solo singles are futile exercises in utter boredom . <sssss> Which is why I had better than average expectations for CHAPTER II , especially after hearing the ingratiating ' Rock Wit U ' , which is by far her best non-collaborative effort to date . <sssss> And there are a couple of other standout tunes , namely the gorgeous ' Breakup 2 Makeup ' ( which shows the singer displaying more vocal range than anyone has ever given her credit for , me included ) and the bouncy synth-driven ' I Found Lovin '' . <sssss> Too bad the good times stop there -- the rest of the set is filled out by recylced , warmed-over beats , seemingly left over from her overrated debut . <sssss> Ultimately , it would have been nice to see the singer build on the three aforementioned songs . <sssss> Instead , what CHAPTER II amounts to is a tired , mostly suprise-free retread of " chapter I " -- does n't really make one look forward to " chapter III " now does it ?
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B00009VRDI	2	OK this isnt as great as her debut album " Ashanti " but this is one huge amazingly cool album only like 4 songs ruin it like " Shanys World " but definitley I totally reccomend it I bought Beyonce 's " Dangerously In Love " and I didnt really like it , the songs ont hat album are boring anyways I 've got more fave songs on " Chapter II " than " Dang . . In . . Luv " come on ppl fuss over Beyonce and not Ashanti anymore I think that needs to change . <sssss> Beyonce 's Cd is starting to sound better : (
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B00009VRDI	5	If you had any doubts about Ashanti 's follow up album or thought she would hit the sophomore slump , than you are in for a rude awakening . <sssss> Ashanti has outdone herself on this lp . <sssss> If you previously thought she had no singing talent then this album will prove to you the reason she got signed . <sssss> This album is simply blazing . <sssss> Personally , I did n't think it could get any better than Monica 's album this year but this album is pushing it . <sssss> It is a great deal better than her debut , which lost it 's flair quickly . <sssss> This album , however , has some staying power . <sssss> As mentioned earlier , she actually SINGS on this album instead of kinda just moaning ; even going as far as surprising me . <sssss> On some songs she just lets loose . <sssss> Every song has a different feel despite what many have already said ( there 's a difference between hating and not-liking ) . <sssss> This album is just got doggone amazing . <sssss> From the smash single ` Rock Wit You ' , to the incredible ` Breakup 2 Makeup ' , to the 80 's feel of ` I Found Lovin ' , to the excellent use of sample on ` Rain On Me ' ( the same sample that Snoop used on the first editions of Doggystyle that later got pulled because they did n't clear the sample ... just a tidbit of info I thought you 'd like to know ) , this album delivers . <sssss> She gets sexy on ` Ooh Ahh ' and ` The Story Of 2 ' is just hot in its smoky night club esque way . <sssss> One thing that slows the album down is the skits ... . <sssss> AHHHHHHHHHHH !!! <sssss> Delete skits !!!!! <sssss> But other than that and Chink Santana talking , I ca n't find a flaw on this album . <sssss> It 's obvious that Ashanti has worked extremely hard on this album and it shines through in its quality . <sssss> Buy this album yesterday .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B00009VRDI	3	I got this cd because I truly enjoyed Ashanti 's 1st album & I wanted to see how she could ( or if she would ) improve upon it . <sssss> Knowing that her vocal skills are limited but intrigued by how courageously she continues to sing live @ events instead of lip-synching as if to prove to us that she deserves the accolades she received last year . <sssss> That being said , while I only skipped 2 songs on her previous disc , Chapter II comes off as a rushed deal to capitalize on her prior success . <sssss> The only songs I truly love are : Rock Wit U , Rain on Me , Living My Life , Feel So Good & I Do n't Mind . <sssss> She needs to lose the skits and maybe take a little longer than a year to produce her third effort . <sssss> I think that with the proper production , Ashanti could be around for another 2-3 albums but if she puts out another like this , she 'll be done by her third . <sssss> I put her in the same category as say , Paula Abdul , Janet Jackson vocally - the only thing that separates Ashanti from her contemporaries and these two ladies is the fact that she can not dance or command a stage enough to make me forget that she really ca n't sing .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B00009VRDI	5	Ashanti is back in her sophomore effort " Chapter II " , and what a treat . <sssss> From the first single " Rock Wit U ( Awww Baby ) " to my favorite remake " Breakup to Makeup " this CD is thorough , with Ashanti always in perfect pitch . <sssss> Forgot Beyonces disaster " Dangerously In Love " , " Chapter II " is the real R&B McCoy . <sssss> Well produced , and with an abundance of singles to comes Ashanti shows she is the queen of R&B . <sssss> Other favorites include " Oooh Ahhh " , " Rain On Me " and " Feels So Good " to name a few . <sssss> Not a bad song in the bunch . <sssss> A sure possibility for a Grammy Nod for Album of the Year and R & B Album of the Year . <sssss> Ashanti you did right .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B00009VRDI	1	This was another album i review without it getting pubblished here so i 'll try again . <sssss> Ashanti was praised as the new queen of hip hop after her first album and i though she would do something much more mature and stronger this time but she did n't , instead this new chapter is even worse and childish then her first album , the beats are bad , the hooks are not existing and the lyrics are too predictable and corny . <sssss> This album was rushed and the new rapper appearing was even worse then Ja Rule , Ashanti needs to start from scrath get herself some decent songwriter and producer , like the Neptunes perhaps before she can get her respect back , this album was really silly . <sssss> Sorry im not feeling it at all .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B00009VRDI	1	I hate to beat a dead horse , but this is hands down the worst cd of the year for 2003 and we are only half way in the year . <sssss> Its hard for me to write this because I know Ashanti is trying really hard , but she just do n't have it . <sssss> She has a nice tone , but she has no range . <sssss> Her songwriting is worst on this album , than on her last album . <sssss> And once again , she is sampling every song from back in the day . <sssss> No Growth . <sssss> Plus , she has those annoying skits with that guy name Chink Santana ( who made you want to scream , " Shut Up all that noise " !!! <sssss> ) . <sssss> I am not hating on this girl , I really tried to like this album , but this album does n't cut it . <sssss> Despite the fact I did n't like her last ( first ) album , I went out like a dummy and purchased this one . <sssss> Never again will I do that . <sssss> This cd is a dub .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00009VRDI	2	How can I explain this to you without saying that this album is just average ... hummm . <sssss> well I guess I ca n't , this album has as many albums today a great hit single " Rock Wit U Awwwwwww Baby " , I just love the Awwwww Baby thang ! <sssss> , and other fairly good tracks like " Rain On Me " , but almost all the album sounds like the late 70 's early 80 's music . <sssss> The songs fades fast out of memory and is full with promotion to other artist , whassup with that ?! <sssss> I have hear to it several times and I can only remember the sounds or chorus lines of " Break Up " and the other one that saids " Dreammaker make my dreams come true .... " , all the songs sound the same . <sssss> Well so sad that singles are not longer available ! <sssss> , this album is not that good as the first one and Ashanti should head up to the studio , cuz I do n't see anymore hit singles in here .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B00009VRDI	4	First thing ... no , I did not make a typo . <sssss> I like Ashanti and I like her music . <sssss> I have gotten ridiculed for it quite a bit . <sssss> But come on . <sssss> She may not be a terrific singer , but by no means is she offensive or terrible . <sssss> And let me also say this . <sssss> There is a time an place for every type of music . <sssss> Sometimes I want me some Erykah Badu or Jill Scott . <sssss> Other times , I 'm just not in the mood and go for the more mainstream stuff like Ashanti . <sssss> With that said , I absolutely loved this album . <sssss> I do not know what is up with the terrible reviews , but I love every song on this album . <sssss> ( Excluding the unnecessary intros , outros and interludes . <sssss> That 's why I downgraded the rating to four stars . <sssss> She really needs to stop with the interludes . <sssss> ) Without all that stuff , there are thirteen catchy , quality tracks . <sssss> She has matured and it shows . <sssss> Her vocals on here are an improvement , too . <sssss> I highly recommend it if you 're a fan or if you 're considering buying it .
A3I675GA2O8I59	B0000AGWEC	2	" MEASURE OF A MAN " ... . <sssss> What a interresting and revealing title for the debut solo CD of the " male waif with dyed eyebrows " . <sssss> On this product , " La diva AIKEN " drowns himself in syrupy musical arangements . <sssss> The artwork on the CD is stylish and simple thus my rating of 2 Stars . <sssss> Vocally , AIKEN produces the image of a wan na be christian cabaret singer hoping to join the troupe UP WITH PEOPLE . <sssss> Loosing his " broadway edge " , he is opts to be produced as a " infomercial singer " . <sssss> This CD casts AIKEN in the spolight of a GRADE B LOUNGE ACT . <sssss> AIKEN must learn to study the contents of his lyrics prior to whaling words into a microphone . <sssss> His vocal techniques will no longer impress television judges but may end up annoying the public at large . <sssss> This CD does make one wonder if AIKEN could be the next SAM HARRIS . <sssss> ( by the way : where is SAM now ? <sssss> ) On a good note , MEASURE OF A MAN does sound perfect once ZAPPED in a microwave . <sssss> After all , it 's coated in a heavy dose of CHEESE . <sssss> Unfortunately , this product is predictable and far less artistic than the products delivered by his peers , KELLY CLARKSON and JUSTIN GUARINI . <sssss> In the long run , artistic content and not " likeability " will be the true test of who can survive the longest under the glare of the musical spotlight . <sssss> Aiken best realize that to be true if he wants to record another CD !
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B0000AGWEC	1	Let me be frank and honest with you people . <sssss> What you have here are a thousand or more posters within a week , praising this cd as if it 's the second coming . <sssss> When I KNOW there 's a Clay Aiken 's fan site that is encouraging fans to post as many good reviews as possible to make this cd seem better than it actually is . <sssss> So let me just say , what this cd is really about . <sssss> It 's another example of a lounge singer getting a deal because of an over-rated addictive music show . <sssss> I listened to this cd five times and each time I became depressed . <sssss> Depressed at the fact that there is an artist out there somewhere being denied the chance to shine , because he 's not AI material . <sssss> While Clay has a good voice , the songs on this album are bland , boring , cheesy , corny and simple . <sssss> The productions sounds JUST like Kelly Clarkston 's album . <sssss> I mean we have heard this music before because Clay offers nothing new or exciting to the music scope . <sssss> This is what I call ` elevator music ' at its worst . <sssss> You can either believe the hype or take it from me ... if you like your music that 's challenging , take risks , different , good , experimental and pushes you mentally , then DO NOT buy this album .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B0000AGWEC	3	I 've got to give Clay credit for at least sticking with what he does best : Singing powerful , romantic adult contemporary ballads . <sssss> I personally do n't own this cd , but I did get a chance to listen to it at a friend 's house . <sssss> I was n't really looking forward to listening to this album , as I 'm not a big fan of entire discs filled with ballads from start to finish ( after watching AI , I assumed Clay 's album would be mostly ballads ) . <sssss> To be truthful , it 's not all that bad . <sssss> I found myself getting a little tired of it about half way through the disc , but this guy really does have a beautiful tone and a lot of power in his voice . <sssss> Like Josh Groban , Clay is gon na have to find other ways to promote his music than radio . <sssss> Adult contemporary radio , though quite limited compared to mainstream , will probably gobble him up like Thanksgiving dinner . <sssss> Seeing that none of the material on this album has an edge or any real punch , mainstream radio is the one place you wo n't find Clay very often . <sssss> Regardless , I bet that he 's gon na have a devoted fan base for years to come . <sssss> As long as he sticks to this formula , he 'll have his fans . <sssss> I 've seen Clay over the last few months trying to look sexier and edgier , but that 's not who he is . <sssss> He 's got a baby face and a voice that belongs on Broadway . <sssss> Honestly , I have never seen anyone look more out of place on the cover of Rolling Stone than Clay . <sssss> Mr. Aiken , please do n't try to be something you are n't . <sssss> Just be exactly who you are and keep on singing ballads . <sssss> Personally , I ca n't imagine him singing anything but adult contemporary ballads . <sssss> Would anything else really do his voice justice ? <sssss> I certainly do n't think so . <sssss> If this gut does n't make it to Broadway someday , the music industry has gone totally loco ...
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B0000AGWEC	1	Ugh ! <sssss> From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover , this guy screams superficiality ! <sssss> Sorry , Clay ... . <sssss> you might have been second in American Idol II ... but you are NOT Barry Manilow ! <sssss> I just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god-given talents and merits to get to superstardom . <sssss> It smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public . <sssss> So many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this . <sssss> Please , spend your money wisely and do n't buy this CD . <sssss> Go out and get yourself ULTIMATE BARRY MANILOW or even a good Celine Dion disc instead . <sssss> At least those folks worked for years to get where they are ... and obviously have some talent . <sssss> Clay , I wish you luck ... but I am sure your career will be history in about a year .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B0000AGWEC	3	DISCLAIMER : No disrespect intended toward anyone , but if you 're one of those people that says , " Man , Ruben Studdard is ten times better than Clay Aiken " ! <sssss> , or even vice versa , then stop reading right now and I 'll see you on my next review . <sssss> ( Ca n't we stop the comparisons already ? <sssss> Come on , they 're not even the same genre . <sssss> ) But if you 're an open-minded person like I am and can appreciate Ruben AND Clay , then read on for a very unbiased review . <sssss> I do n't think I have to remind anyone where Clay Aiken really got his start , but at any rate , he does have a pretty good voice . <sssss> Sometimes , though , he has a habit of oversinging , especially in " I Survived You " . <sssss> But he still sounds as good as ever on " This Is the Night " ( although I 'm not sure why it 's considered a bonus cut when it 's in the middle of the album ) . <sssss> And when I read the liner notes and saw that " When You Say You Love Me " was co-written by former Savage Garden frontman Darren Hayes , I thought it was going to be cheese-o-rama , but it really is n't . <sssss> However , there are a few missteps . <sssss> " I Will Carry You " is a little too sappy , and the first single , " Invisible " ( which sounds a little like Michelle Branch 's hit " Breathe " ) , has rather confusing lyrics . <sssss> The rest of the songs are decent . <sssss> There are n't really any songs that 'll make you stop what you 're doing and pay attention to them , but there are n't any throwaway tracks on here either . <sssss> If you 're really into Clay , pick this up . <sssss> Otherwise , listen to the album in the store or something and then decide for yourself . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B0000AGWEC	1	first of all Clay Aiken has a decent Voice but make no mistake about it Ruben clearly was the Man Vocally of the two . <sssss> Clay has this Safe run of the mill Material which He should n't be doing so soon . <sssss> but then again considering what Rod Stewart has been doing with His Last two Projects then I think Clay should have done that instead . <sssss> Rod needs these Songs & Clay needs to do what Rod is doing . <sssss> nothing on here has Knock Out written on it . <sssss> very Bland & dry . <sssss> Clay deserves better than this .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B0000AGWEC	4	Sure , back in the day we had Frank Sinatra then Elvis and of course there 's Michael Jackson , but face it ... the ladies have been showing us guys up in the singing department for years . <sssss> Just listen to Mariah , Celine , and Christina . <sssss> But now , we have Clay ! <sssss> Clay Aiken is all about the voice , and what a voice he has ! <sssss> Still , I must admitt that the album itself might take a few listens to truly enjoy . <sssss> Even though Clay is immensely talented , I think the song son the album could 've been slightly better . <sssss> Still , there are definite winners here . <sssss> " This Is the Night " which was incidently a # 1 hit is probably my favorite . <sssss> It 's a gorgeous ballad . <sssss> And of course , we have the present more uptempo-ish single " Invisible " which is quite catchy . <sssss> The ballads " I Will Carry You " and " The Way " are two more highlights . <sssss> " Perfect Day " is another favorite of mine as is " Run To Me " . <sssss> " Measure of Man " is heavy on power ballads , yet Clay 's vocals talents manage to cover up the blandness of his material . <sssss> Still , such a talent deserves better songs . <sssss> Clay is a welcomed change from the horrible hip hop culture that 's taken over . <sssss> If you like Clay * aka ... people who can sing * I also recommend Kelly Clarkson 's " Thankful " .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B0000AGWEC	3	Regardless of who the votes preseived as the winner , its 100 % clear who the real winner was . <sssss> Aiken is so talented that with a little work , he will without a doubt escape his American Idol past and have one of the longest and most successful careers of any male pop star in history . <sssss> While that maybe a very bold statement to say , its something that is fully achievable for this rising superstar . <sssss> His voice is great , and he has complete control over his vocal ability . <sssss> The writers & production team that worked on this album did a fantastic job , as it could easily appeal to all audiences . <sssss> The album 's lead single " This is the Night " is a gorgeously composed ballad , brilliantly written and just as brilliantly sung . <sssss> The new single " Invisible " , is the perfect follow-up , an up-tempo rock influenced pop record similar to those recorded by such artists as Third Eye Blind . <sssss> Other potential chart toppers include " I Will Carry You " , " When You Say You Love Me " , " Touch " & " Measure of a Man " . <sssss> Clay proves he is a very versitile artist , proving to the world that he could easy flip between genres . <sssss> With Reuben keeping relatively silent , its been Clay that has bum-rushed the media . <sssss> Having already done appearences on Jay Leno & the Ms. America pagent , being on the front cover of Rolling Stone magazine , and selling an astonishing 613 , 000 units of his debut album first week ( easily surpassing Kelly Clarkson , whose Thankful pushed 297 , 000 units , and crushing Justin Guarini who pushed an embarrising 68 , 000 units first week ) , its clear that America realizes the mistake they made and are now embracing Aiken as the real winner . <sssss> I 'm still waiting on that Kimberley Locke solo album though .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B0000AGWEC	4	I saw this kid on Letterman last night and I think he 's getting ready to take over da world . <sssss> His voyce is beautiful and his songs are pleasing . <sssss> I ca n't figure out why there 's so many playa hataz out there against this guy , but maybe it 's because you 're all jealous . <sssss> This guy will be around for a long , long time , so git used to it. <sssss> He 's way better than Justin and all the other perpetrators . <sssss> This guy ai n't the disease or even a symptom of the disease , not even close . <sssss> Do n't hate the playa foolz ... hate the game .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B0000AGWEC	5	" Measure of a Man " is Clay Aiken 's debut album . <sssss> His powerful voice is amazingly beyond words ! <sssss> It blends perfectly with his pop / soft rock theme . <sssss> It 's great that he represents pop mainstream artists deserving such level of fame . <sssss> His ballads contain the impact that forces the listeners to feel what he 's singing . <sssss> He begins the album with the fast paced hit single " Invincible " , which introduces what 's to come throughout this musical journey . <sssss> Regardless the level of music intensity on each individual track , he never loses his quality or his soul , even when he abandons his rock theme on " The Way " . <sssss> Such flawless quality answers why " This Is the Night " became the biggest selling single of 2003 and why this album debuted at number one on Billboard Top 200 Albums Charts . <sssss> " Measure of a Man " proves that he 'll continue entertaining for a long time . <sssss> Many listeners will be entertained regardless of favorite music genre .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B0000AGWEC	4	I had to prepare myself before listening to this CD for the first time meaning : a ) listen with an open mind , b ) base the merits of the CD on the CD itself and not the American Idol propaganda machine and c ) squelch all the Clay-hype I have myself . <sssss> After I did all those things ... . <sssss> here 's what I found : The producers were really SMART about the material they put on this disc . <sssss> The material is above average , but not outstanding like the Kelly Clarkson CD . <sssss> 100 % of the songs on the CD are slower in nature , meaning you wo n't find any upbeat dance songs . <sssss> The vocal / music mixing is very high quality and Niklas Flyckt should be on Clay 's Grammy thank-yous if he wins one . <sssss> It 's really hard to estimate the chances of these songs charting because they are not really attention grabbing ... they are just really nice . <sssss> I did , however , really enjoy " When You Say You Love Me " , " Shine " , " Perfect Day " and " Touch " . <sssss> These all ' should ' stand a good chance for charting , but they are very similar in style ... so only demand will tell . <sssss> I do have one complaint though , putting " This Is The Night " on there as a BONUS TRACK ?? <sssss> Uhhh ... that 's the song that was at # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks and you put it on as a BONUS TRACK ?? <sssss> Well , geez , Management 19 ... thanks for throwing us a bone , although I think labeling this as a bonus track is a bit pretentious .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B0000AGWFX	3	This double album is very cool , and VERY HYPED , ill cut to the chaseGood songs on Speakerboxxx : The Way you move :( and BowtieGood songs on The Love below , nearly all of em , maybe some not , but here are some : Hey Ya ! <sssss> , Roses ( I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH I LOVE IT I LOVE IT , THIS DESERVES A BAJILLION STARS ! <sssss> ) , Draculas Wedding , Take of your cool , a day in the life of Benjamin Andre , all out its good , Speakerboxx Disc1 : 2.2 StarsThe Love Below : 3.4 StarsAll condensed 3 stars , Try it out tho !
A3I675GA2O8I59	B0000AGWFX	5	SPEAKERBOXXX ranks amongst the best CDs of the past 15 years ! <sssss> This CD is a musical masterpiece that should be considered as the ultimate recording for " HIP HOP / RAP / URBAN " . <sssss> To produce and compose the amount of music available on this project and to present it in an intelligent format that is strong yet accessible to the mass market is BRILLIANT . <sssss> Even have you never embraced this musical style in the past , I dare you to try this product out . <sssss> It will soon become one of your favorites . <sssss> A MUST OWN Cd .
A1UH3S1GVFSMFH	B0000AGWFX	5	Ahhhhh ... " Speakerboxx " , the best R&B ; , Pop masterpiece to come out in a lllllllooooonnnnng time . <sssss> With the breakout smash " Hey Yeah " to the Earth Wind and Firesque " The Way You Move " . <sssss> This CD rocks on all facets . <sssss> With other classics " Roses " , .... " Roses smell like poo poo poo " , to " Church " to the ever classic " Where Are My Panties " ? <sssss> to the clever " Draculas Wedding " . <sssss> Outkast shows how totally two different music backgrounds can come together and create an artistic musical wonder . <sssss> What a great album , that wo n't be leaving my CD player for a long time . <sssss> Deserves the grammies it received this year . <sssss> A most definite must for your CD music collection .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0000AGWFX	4	Outkast came strong on the tracks this time around ... . <sssss> so strong that both dre and big boi came up with 19 tracks a piece to give you a two disc set . <sssss> One side " The Love below " and the other side " Speakerboxx " . <sssss> Creativley Dre came stronger this time going for a more prince vibe than rap while Big boi sticks to the original outkast formula . <sssss> Overall I like no one disc more than the other since both are like night and day from each other . <sssss> My only complaint is that I hoped that dre rapped more on the cd but thats minor after listening to what was made here . <sssss> Every song brings something different which is why I wont go into which track is better or worse ..... . <sssss> its more as a whole . <sssss> Any Outkast fan should have this by now...non-fans might want to give this a try . <sssss> Get it !
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B0000AGWFX	5	I was really skeptical about this new cd by OutKast . <sssss> 2000 's STANKONIA was such a good one ... <sssss> I was n't sure that they could top it . <sssss> While this disc does n't top that previous outing , it does do a good job at showcasing both Big Boi 's and Andre 3000 's raw talents ... and giving us an eclectic mix of hip-hop and soul funk . <sssss> I have only listened to the cd once , and found it kind of hard to get into . <sssss> But , I have been listening to HEY YA and THE WAY YOU MOVE on the radio ... and have found both of those songs growing on me ... . <sssss> so just like STANKONIA and AQUEMINI ... <sssss> I suspect that this album will grow on me too after a few listens . <sssss> I just really appreciate the fact that these guys are a little more intellectual in their rapping ... and they take the hip-hop to an artistic level . <sssss> It is a really fresh change over hearing songs about clubbing , pimping , women , and 24-inch rims . <sssss> I think that OutKast will be around for a long time ... and maybe rappers like 50-Cent should maybe take a good hard lesson from them .
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B0000AGWFX	4	... who cares , when the flow is this effervescent and beautiful ? <sssss> Two divergent solo discs , each possessing each owns ' singular funkdified delights , Andre without Big Boi , Big Boi without Andre , each threaded , this time , by a common moniker and sold as a double unit . <sssss> Pretty astute business sense - released as separate entities , a sales impact as remarkable as this one proved would be hard to substantiate . <sssss> So chalk one up for industry and let 's dance along our jovial way . <sssss> But do n't negate ` art ' either - this is a confection that revels in the whole of it 's excessive parts , with nary a misstep along the way . <sssss> Hyperbole aside , it 's not a sonic landmark as ` Stankonia ' proved to be - but it is rock and roll and funk and soul and r & b and hip-hop all juxtaposed for the beauty of the earth . <sssss> My grade : A -
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B0000AGWFX	3	firs toff the bat Andre 3000 has the most risk taking set but having said that He ca n't pull off a whole CD . <sssss> 7-8 songs tops . <sssss> Vocally He reminds of Rick James , Prince , P-Funk & a bit of R. Kelly in there , Sugarfoot from the Ohio Players . <sssss> Dre is Channeling many of His Influences left & right . <sssss> " Prototype " is the stand cut from Him to Me. <sssss> as for Big Boi : I 'd say between 4-5 Songs of His should have made the cut . <sssss> if these Cats split the Disc up with 7 solo songs apiece on One disc then it would have probably been alot better . <sssss> as it stands while Dre has the Overall Creative Edge he still does n't have enough Depth without Big Boi therefore they should never think about Solo Careers . <sssss> some of the Production & Instrumentation on Both Sets have Moments but these Cats are better together than apart overall in the bigger picture to me & it shows here . <sssss> they truly Compliment one another . <sssss> this Album is way over-hyped to me as well . <sssss> it has some decent tracks but does n't even come to the way it 's being Hyped up to me overall .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B0000AGWFX	5	Well , this is definetly a unique 2CD set . <sssss> The songs , styles , material is all over the place , but it 's very entertaining . <sssss> After my first spin , I found that I had listened very closely , laughed a lot , grooved to the beat and kicked back and relaxed . <sssss> I can completely understand why this album won the 2004 Grammy for Album of the Year ... it 's very good . <sssss> With all that said , you 'd probably be surprised if I said I do n't like rap and am not a big fan of R&B ; , so for me to give this 5 stars is surprising , but it earned it . <sssss> The highlights are : 1 ) An abundance of material and a great price !! <sssss> When was the last time you picked up a double disc set with nearly FORTY cuts and under $ 20 ?? <sssss> 2 ) Quality and detailed musicianship . <sssss> If you listen carefully , you can tell the attention to detail . <sssss> 3 ) Progressive material . <sssss> They are on the cutting edge throughout this compilation with very few throwback songs , yep , this is a trip to the future . <sssss> 4 ) Replayability . <sssss> A round of applause to this duo . <sssss> They have expanded my appreciation for music a bit further , something that is not easy to do .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B0000AGWFX	5	A true masterpiece . <sssss> Big boi and Dre take hip hop to another level on this epic . <sssss> Split into 2 ` solo ' cds , it 's tough to pick a favourite , unless you like just rap , or just singing , then you can pick . <sssss> Standouts include the lyrically superior ` War ' , ` The way you move ' , ` Happy valentine 's day ' , the rather cheeky ` Spread ' , ` She lives in my lap ' , ` Flip flop rock ' , ` Unhappy ' , ` Reset ' , the jazzy break of ` My favourite things ' , as well as the jazzy duet with Norah Jones on ` Take off your cool ' . <sssss> Full of socially relevant lyrics , as well as tonnes of humour ( especially on Dre 's disc ) , there is never a dull moment . <sssss> Even the interludes , especially ` God ' and ` Bamboo ' will have one splitting ones sides . <sssss> Easily the best cd of 2003 . <sssss> Get your copy now !! 
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B0000AGWFX	5	Not being an avid fan of rap music , I find myself being drawn to the sound of Atlanta 's own Outkast . <sssss> The duo 's sound is an eclectic blend of George Clinton / Bootsy Collins-inspired 70 's P-funk , the 50 's jazzy sound of Miles and Quincy , the eroticism and intricacies of Prince , the sophistication of the Motown Sound , the frenzy of a Sunday morning gospel choir , and even the exhuberant and playful rock of the 60 's . <sssss> While staying true to their hip-hop roots , Andre 3000 and Big Boi have branched out and produced a release that appeals to both the teens , their parents and their grandparents , even with the abundance of " expletives " and sexual references . <sssss> Buoyed by the strength of the two current chart favorites , " The Way You Move " and " Hey Ya " , " Speakerboxx / The Love Below " is a hip-hop tour de force that , come Grammy Award night , should rival Michael Jackson 's " Thriller " in the statue department !
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000AGWFX	5	It 's no doubt that Outkast it 's one of the few music groups out there that with each new album the propose new venues to it , they do n't stick to the formula and that 's what 's happening here , proving that Andre and Big Boi are totally talented , the frist two single went to number # 1 , " The Way You MOve " a delightful track reminiscence of the 80 's pop-r & b scene , a great beat with excellent lyrics about love and desire , and Hey Ya ! <sssss> , the most innovative single in years , takin ' back music to a fun edge between the 60 's a la Supremes style , these song reminds about what music it 's all about fun ! <sssss> , the third single " Roses " it 's another superb track that it 's based on an story line that delivers you a great story , a song that it 's really worth the album , this double cd , will satisfy your need in any style of music that you dig , no wonder this two guys are the top act of music these days , check only the videos of each single release , there like the Madonna and Michael Jackson videos , will become classics , Hey Ya ! <sssss> with the 60 's show and the green colors , The Way You MOve a-la-Billy Joel , the mechanic the dancing saloon , and Roses , well just like the 50 's -60 's grooves , parody of an odd Grease including appearences by the all time choreographer supreme idol Paula Abdul . <sssss> This album is one of the best of 2003 and counting .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B0000AGWFX	5	My initial review of this masterwork was written in haste and I did n't really give the LP the time and attention it truly desrved . <sssss> After a few dozen more listens and hearing just how well the 2 discs go together , but stand equally strong on their own , I am convinced that this is Outkast 's strongest work to date . <sssss> While I 'm still quite partial to THE LOVE BELOW , SPEAKERBOXX , took a little longer to grow on me and now it makes perfect sense . <sssss> It seemed a bit ramshackle and unfocused at first , but once I put aside my fond memories of " Stankonia " and listened to it without making comparisons , my ears have never been happier . <sssss> Mixing various strains of techno , crunk , drum 'n' bass , southern funk and Miami bass music , Big Boi has created a diverse , jolting piece of work that reveals a little something different with each spin . <sssss> Dre 's disc ..... . <sssss> still leaves me speechless . <sssss> Who would have thought a decade ago that he would produce a ballad as lovely as " Prototype " ( best moment ; his beautiful guitar intro with two countermelodies playing against each other and his first chorus of . <sssss> ' I think I 'm in LOOOOOOOVE again . <sssss> ' is sheer magic ) and the sheer pop perfection of " Hey Ya " ! <sssss> His modern take on dignity , pride and class " Behold A Lady " is head nodding funk at it 's best and his conversation with The Almighty ( " GOD " ) over a gorgeous acoustic guitar backdrop is an instant classic . <sssss> The Grammy committee finally got it right this year and only confirmed what us longtime fans have known since 94 's " Player 's Ball " , Outkast are futuristic , funky and just plain brilliant !
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B0000AGWGD	4	I love Ruben Studdard and think he has gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to his music career . <sssss> When he popped up on American Idol last season during the Wild Card show , Fox did nothing to promote his appearance . <sssss> However when Clay shows up , he gets all the promotion !? <sssss> Ruben won and deserves some respect . <sssss> If there had been more promotion for him , he could have sold many more albums than he did . <sssss> As for the songs , they could have been better , but most of them are pretty good . <sssss> People have complained about the more hip hop songs , but I 'm glad he made what he wanted to make rather than cater to every possible demographic there is . <sssss> If the album had been all slow love songs , it would have been boring . <sssss> My only complaint is the inclusion of some songs he sang on the show . <sssss> If they had to be included , why not include some that he sounded better on . <sssss> I do n't even remember " For All We Know " and " How Can You Mend a Broken Heart " . <sssss> The original songs are pretty good . <sssss> " Sorry 2004 " was a good song for him , and " What Is Sexy " ? <sssss> is an interesting song . <sssss> I also love " After the Candles Burn " . <sssss> They may not have groundbreaking lyrics , but who cares ? <sssss> Ruben sounds good on them and that 's all that matters . <sssss> I recommend this album . <sssss> I suspect the reason for all these negative reviews may be Clay fans who have too much time on their hands and want to waste their time giving Ruben 's album a lower score . <sssss> That 's their problem . <sssss> As for the people who did listen to the CD and still did n't like it , that 's their opinion and I respect that . <sssss> Not everyone likes everything . <sssss> Speaking as someone who liked it and did listen to it , I suggest checking it out .
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B0000AGWGD	3	October 5th , 2010Ruben Studdard has a wondrous voice . <sssss> I do n't know where it is on this CD but it only comes out in pieces . <sssss> And have you heard some of these tracks ? <sssss> They really try hard to be ghetto fabulous . <sssss> Not feelin ' it ! <sssss> There are some tolerable tracks though . <sssss> ' Sorry 2004 ' is decent , although it was overplayed back in the day . <sssss> ' Take A Shot ' is OK , but nothing remarkable . <sssss> As is ' Play Our Song ' . <sssss> The remakes here are nice , but none of them touch the originals . <sssss> My favorite track is actually still ' Flying Without Wings ' . <sssss> I think that song almost made me cry before . <sssss> It 's so soaring . <sssss> Besides ' FWW ' , ' After The Candles Burn ' is probably my next favorite track . <sssss> All in all , Soulfulis very hit and miss . <sssss> Too many ghetto wannabe tracks here . <sssss> More than I could tolerate . <sssss> If you want to make it urban , actually make it worth listening to ! <sssss> 3 stars or a 6/10 . <sssss> DOWNLOAD : ' Flying Without Wings ' & ' After The Candles Burn '
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B0000AGWGD	2	Who here remembers that Ruben Studdard won the second season of American Idol ? <sssss> Nobody ... ok just checking . <sssss> With Clay Aiken ( last season 's runner-up ) heavily dominating the charts , america 's ' velvet teddy bear ' became old news and kept suprisingly quiet after his controversial win . <sssss> Now that he has surfaced again , its clear that he should have kept quite . <sssss> The album 's miserable first single " Sorry 2004 " has generated absolutely no following what-so-ever , never mind radio airplay . <sssss> Ruben 's main problem is that instead of following in the foot steps of the traditional American Idol contestants and attacking the pop market , he has decided to switch it up and take a swing at the RnB side of the industry . <sssss> While its always wise to blaze one 's own trails , its beyond foolish to entire a genre of music where every male artist sounds exactly the same , literally . <sssss> One listen to " Sorry 2004 " on the radio and you 'll never know its Ruben , because it could have been Tyrese , Avant , Dave Hollister , Ginuwine or Case . <sssss> His hopes of becoming the next Luther Vandross are slim to none . <sssss> Had it not been for Justin Guarini , Soulful would easily be the worst AI spin off yet . <sssss> Do n't get me wrong Ruben sounds fantastic on this album , his voice has stunning as ever , but the songs here lack the material to show that off . <sssss> In fact , with the exception of " Flying Without Wings " & " Superstar " ( two previously released numbers ) , I could n't find myself getting into anything else . <sssss> The man famous for representing the ' 205 ' comes up short once all is said and done . <sssss> You know you are in trouble when you like the album cover art more than the songs on the album . <sssss> Any who , Studdard is a great single and a young man who has time to find himself , recooporate and hit the studio again . <sssss> There is no doubt in my mind though that young fans of the show will scoop of millions of these .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B0000AGWGD	3	Everyone knows who Ruben Studdard is so there should n't be an introduction . <sssss> Ruben can sing a lil sumthin sumthin and on choice songs he RESEMBLES Johnny Gill . <sssss> The lyrics and songwriting are just aight ; not very powerful . <sssss> That makes some of the songs seem like they drag on ( For All We Know ) . <sssss> But he gets down on songs like Sorry 2004 , After The Candles Burn , Superstar , and Flying Without Wings that definitely show his vocal power . <sssss> He gets down with Jazze Pha on Play Our Song and Swizz Beats comes through on Do n't Quit On Me . <sssss> The album falls flat on songs like Take The Shot , What Is Sexy , and Can I Get Your Attention but the good far outweigh the bad . <sssss> Overall Ruben drops a formidable debut album ; there 's room for improvement . <sssss> Fans of the show or Ruben should definitely checc out his first effort as a solo artist . <sssss> 3.5 stars .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0000AGWGD	3	By now everyone knows ruben from either American Idol , or hearing someone talk about him on the idol , or somewhere in the media ..... . <sssss> he 's known and heard . <sssss> Now comes the moment of truth with the new solo cd ..... . <sssss> Soulful ... . <sssss> was it worthy of his talent ? <sssss> Yes . <sssss> It is a strong start for ruben and I was surprised that it was this good . <sssss> I see reviews saying it wasent good or anything like american idol ..... . <sssss> of corse not and I wouldnt want it to be either .... . <sssss> mostly since those songs are remakes and only show a small part of the artist . <sssss> You really know the talent of a singer if they can make anythign sound godo and here you can see that . <sssss> He has a lot of mid-tempo and slow tracks on this cd that really give you what Ruben is about .... . <sssss> Like what ? <sssss> * Sorry 2004 -- A nice mid-tempo song with ruben giving his resolutions on a new start . <sssss> Very appropriate second single . <sssss> ( Video is good too if you havent seen it ) * No Ruben * How can you mend a Broken heart -- One of the best remakes here . <sssss> A whole new spark for a old song . <sssss> * What is Sexy -- Tight mid-tempo track with fat joe . <sssss> Reminds me of " Real Love " Form Mary J. Blige . <sssss> * What If * For all we know * After the candles burn -- This song here is the best slow jam . <sssss> Played it a million times ... this must be the next single . <sssss> * We have not forgotten -- Ruben shows his gospel roots on this one . <sssss> These songs right here is where ruben truely represents in any kind of way . <sssss> I really rate this a 3.5 stars instead . <sssss> It could have been flawless minus some mediocore songs but overall it wasent enough to stop it from still being really good . <sssss> I didnt buy into the hype until hearing this cd .... . <sssss> but now that I have I can truely say he can sing . <sssss> Get it ! 
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B0000AGWGD	1	It is a bad day for music when your ears are horribly scarred by the absolutely TERRIBLE music eminating from the sample music box in the electronics section of a local store . <sssss> However , this was the case with this CD , Soulful , by Ruben Studdard . <sssss> The thing sounds like someone put the same mid-tempo sample behind Ruben as he sang each tune . <sssss> How terrible is that ! <sssss> Not to mention , Ruben simply does n't have the full capabilities of his voice at hand throughout this album . <sssss> I think Ruben has some talent , but I think more energy was used in creating Clay Aiken 's album ... . <sssss> even though both of them are equally sad . <sssss> Why are the American people so eager to act like a flock of headless sheep and listen to this tripe ? <sssss> Have we gotten to the place that we will accept anything ( or anyone ) the media thinks is " good " ? <sssss> Granted , Mr. Studdard has some talent ... but he needs to leave the American Idol thing behind ... along with the rest of us .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B0000AGWGD	2	I think the people who are coming to this board to slam Ruben and praise Clay are totally wrong and unfair . <sssss> There is a reviewer by the name of Peter ( from Canada ) who wrote a review on December 27 , 2003 entitled " Nope " . <sssss> He slammed someone for making the competition between Clay and Ruben a " race " issue , but he turns around and do the same thing in his review that day ? <sssss> Who is he to say how black people should feel about the cover art ? <sssss> The question I have for him is ... did he even listen to this album because if he did n't , he should n't be writing reviews That 's being mean and hateful . <sssss> He knows it and I know it. <sssss> As for this cd , I do n't like it . <sssss> To me , the only young soulful male artist is R. Kelly , Maxwell and D'Angelo . <sssss> To me , this cd sounds like corporate soul . <sssss> Just like Clay is corporate pop . <sssss> I do n't it . <sssss> I will take Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , Al Green and Earth Wind & Fire any day over these jokers ( like Ruben ) . <sssss> Sorry , but I do not like this cd .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B0000AGWGD	4	Sure , the first single released ( " Flying Without Wings " ) was sappy but it was the type of fluff that makes it on pop radio and endears itself to a cross-section of the listening public . <sssss> However , it is on songs like the hit " Sorry 2004 " , " What If " , the self-penned " We Have Not Forgotten " and covers of Al Green 's " How Can You Mend a Broken Heart " and Luther 's " Superstar " that the singer gets to show his potential as a solid R & B artist . <sssss> The album is far from perfect with its attempt to appeal to all audiences ; there is too much of a variety depriving the singer of an opportunity to establish his own " voice " . <sssss> Maybe on his next effort the singer will concentrate on one style , for it 's obvious that he 's comfortable with many musical genres . <sssss> But , as a whole , it 's not a bad beginning for someone destined for many years of " idol " worship .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B0000AGWGD	4	Of all the contestants on " American Idol " , Ruben Studdard is the only one who even remotely sparked my interest . <sssss> The other contestants do n't do it for me . <sssss> Kelly Clarkson ? <sssss> A watered down Celine Dion ( who 's watered down to begin with ) . <sssss> Clay Aiken ? <sssss> Thanks , but I 'll pass . <sssss> And I wo n't even comment on Justin Guarini , who parted ways from his label RCA after just one album . <sssss> But Studdard did intrigue me and compelled me to try his debut " Soulful " . <sssss> While this record is n't perfect , I do n't see how anyone who actually listened to the album could give it one star and honestly say they 're being fair . <sssss> Even more , Studdard is often compared to Clay Aiken , which completely defies logic . <sssss> You may as well be comparing Janis Joplin to Britney Spears . <sssss> But I digress . <sssss> As modern r & b records go , " Soulful " ( which was executive produced by Clive Davis ) is flawlessly crafted and well executed . <sssss> Studdard has no reason to make anyone forget about Luther Vandross , but he has a fine voice and some pretty good tunes to go with it . <sssss> The album is divided between tender ballads , uptempo cuts and even a light dash of hip hop . <sssss> Standout tracks are " No Ruben " , the Bee Gees cover " How Do You Mend a Broken Heart " , the infectious " Do n't Quit On Me " produced by Swizz Beatz , and his version of " Superstar " , a song Vandross already made famous . <sssss> A couple weak spots do pop up , including the single " Flying Without Wings " , which I never thought was strong enough to do Studdard 's voice justice . <sssss> But if you remove yourself from the " A.I. " hype and examine " Soulful " on its own merits , you 'll find that it 's really one of the better r & b records of 2003 , which is saying a lot . <sssss> He may not sell as many records as Kelly and Clay , but he did release an album that 's worthy of my attention and 4 stars .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B0000AKOMI	5	R&B girls may be a dime a dozen , but artists like Kelis are one in a million . <sssss> With her gritty vocal delivery and crazy hip shaking beats , Kelis symolizes that there are still singers in this world that are original and worth listening to . <sssss> From beginning to end , there is not a single moment in this album that I would consider boring . <sssss> The fun literally never stops . <sssss> This disc is n't nearly as wild as her 2000 debut album , but the music is all standout material and fantastically colorful . <sssss> Definitely a lot of bang for your buck .
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B0000AKOMI	4	" Tasty " is an interesting album , this album definitley isnt all " Milkshake " ! <sssss> it has a few radio songs like " Trick Me " and an Alicia Keys / Janet " Sugar Honey Iced Tea " , overall Kelis has done a really cool start to the music charts , I mean she is more mainstream now than " Kaliedescope " and " Wanderland " , " Milkshake " is the catchiest damn song out in ages and " Trick me " is just so listenable ! <sssss> I love this , it isnt album of the year , but very cool , and from memory right now was she nominated for a grammy ?!? <sssss> , oh well very coolm give it a taste , if your not sure try get it out of a libray or something . <sssss> Very cool , go Kelis !
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B0000AKOMI	5	Kelis returns with her third release , and after the sonic brilliance that was her first two albums how can we expect any more ? <sssss> Well ladies & gentlemen , Kelis has managed to outdo herself and the rest of the music industry . <sssss> This new album from Kelis , titled TASTY , is simply amazing . <sssss> Her lyrics are on point , the backdrops are amazing , and her singing is heavenly . <sssss> She is so FUNKY . <sssss> Her voice is very unique and so is her style . <sssss> I knew I should have gotten excited when I heard her on THE LOVE BELOW : on Draculas Wedding-another amazing song . <sssss> But who knew Andre 3000 and Kelis had so much chemistry ? <sssss> If they did an album together it would be amazing because Millionaire , featured on the album , is just that . <sssss> Marathon is borderline timeless . <sssss> The first single Milkshake is OFF THE CHAIN . <sssss> Oh goodness !!! <sssss> She deep fried this album with some Crisco or something . <sssss> Keep It Comin is another classic .... " Dope Boi Fresh in All Yo Clothes " . <sssss> Her Raphael Saadiq collabos are nothing short of brilliant : Glow & Attention are complete masterpieces . <sssss> Every song is tight and there are no skip songs trust me . <sssss> Stick Up , In Public , Protect My Heart , Sugar Honey Iced Tea , Rolling Through The Hood ... every single song . <sssss> With Tasty , Kelis has hands down released the greatest soul record of the year ( yes even better than Erykah Badu 's Worldwide Underground ) . <sssss> So with that said ; in the words of Jay-Z ... " What the hell are you waiting for ?!?! " Get This album right now . <sssss> A Masterpiece .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0000AKOMI	4	I am a Kelis fan and bought this disc with high hopes of hearing the same original music that I 'd heard on her 1st , Kaleidescope & was not disappointed . <sssss> Of course , the catchy " Milkshake " was released 1st - it is the type of single that got people talking and that is just what Kelis needed after being out of the scene for a while . <sssss> I think the songs produced by Raphael Sadiqq are phenomenal and either Glow or Attention s/b the second single released . <sssss> The songs with the Neptunes are just " ok " in my book , the only one that really stood out other than Milkshake is Sugar Honey Iced Tea. <sssss> I do n't think Kelis " sold out " as one other reviewer put it , this along with Mya & Monica 's cds is one of the most refreshing & original r & b albums released in 2003 . <sssss> IMO the best tracks are : Glow , Sugar Honey Iced Tea , Attention , In Public , Millionaire , Milkshake , Rolling Through the Hood , Keep it Down & Protect My Heart .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0000AKOMI	4	Kelis ..... . <sssss> The girl that used to " Hate you so much right now " is now all about having that milkshake everyone wants to have . <sssss> One of the thigns that pulled me in on kelis is her sound and hwo she came across in songs . <sssss> Very different to the norm of R+B which made it something like alternative R+B . <sssss> Her first cd is still classic and the second was also good ( Although it wasent released in the U.S ) and now this brigns us to tasty . <sssss> She came strong this time around with milkshake ... giving her her first # 3 single and maybe soon # 1 . <sssss> It also includes 2 songs from her last cd which I guess she felt were good enough a second time around . <sssss> Now to the tracks ... whats good ? <sssss> * Trick me * Milkshake -- neptunes always come through with the hto tracks for kelis . <sssss> * In Public * Flashback * Protect my Heart -- Uses a remake very well . <sssss> Nice . <sssss> * Glow -- raphael saadiq works well with her ... they should do more tracks together . <sssss> * Sugar , Honey , Iced tea * Attention * Stick up -- the beat is tight * Marathon -- the beat and melody is very different and she really sings on this one . <sssss> These right here give you the new flavor that Kelis brings this time around thats good . <sssss> As you already notice , this is about the whole album ... but its good . <sssss> She balances thigns well by letting other artists have input on the record showing that she isnt just a neptunes creation . <sssss> Concious tracks , sexual tracks ... fast , midtempo to slow she brings it all . <sssss> This is a good step up from Kalidascope and any fan should get this one....non-fans give it a try . <sssss> Overall without hesitation ... Get It !
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B0000AKOMI	4	Wow ... . <sssss> what a provocative CD case . <sssss> Kelis sitting atop a root beer float on the back cover has to be one of the most sexually-suggestive photos I have seen in a while . <sssss> It really intrigued me to buy this CD and give it a try . <sssss> I bought Kaleidoscope back in 1998/1999 and was a bit disappointed ... so I was a bit skeptical with this new disc . <sssss> However , I am glad I let my eyes do the walking and talking to my brain ! <sssss> This CD is actually really good . <sssss> There are many styles represented here ... and it is easy to tell who produced what . <sssss> MILKSHAKE is the best song on the album , but the one before it is equally as good . <sssss> PROTECT MY HEART is pretty nice as well . <sssss> I would vote to give Kelis a chance . <sssss> She is the female version of OutKast ... a little on the artsy side ... but FUN all the same !
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B0000AKOMI	4	Kelis 's third album " Tasty " is more than good . <sssss> The first single " Milkshake " became a big hit peaking at # 3 in Billboard 's Hot 100 . <sssss> Actually the whole album is a hit . <sssss> Kelis 's voice is amazing , very sexy and the lyrics can go from sexual to romantic . <sssss> The music style includes Hip Hop , Rock , Pop and R&B . <sssss> ; The production of this album is purely first class with producers indluding The Neptunes and Andr&eacute; 3000 ( Outkast ) . <sssss> " Tasty " also includes some special guests like Nas and Andr&eacute; 3000 . <sssss> If you liked the smash # 1 hit " Hey ya " ! <sssss> , you 'll like track # 8 ( " Millionaire " ) that was produced and includes the participation of Andr&eacute; . <sssss> The song follows " Hey ya 's " ! <sssss> same direction . <sssss> In my opinion the best songs in the album are " Milkshake " , " Keep it down " , " In public " , " Protect my heart " and " Attention " . <sssss> The Intro is also very good . <sssss> I 'd recommend this album 's explicit version .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B0000AKOMI	4	included lots of good songs , but this one is going better . <sssss> If you like awesome beats and funky samples mixed with good hooks you 'll love this , The Neptunes are ofcourse behind the music once again . <sssss> " Milkshake " is almost on top of the charts and that 's only one of the many good sogs here . <sssss> Others are " Flashback " " Protect my heart " and " Millionaire " With Andree of Outkast . <sssss> " In Public " she 'll teams up with suberb rapper Nas , and Raphael Sadiq appears on " Attention " " and Glow " . <sssss> Pretty much guest artistst but it makes the album better , maybe her last album was too un-interesting without them ? <sssss> a must buy album anyway .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B0000AKOMI	4	I love Kelis because she is different , but I have to agree with another reviewer who stated that she is not as cutting edge as Joi . <sssss> But I think she is getting there , but need to start writing her own songs and stop relying on others for material . <sssss> " Tasty " reminds me of 80s R&B ; and British R&B ; and is not as cutting edge as " Kaliedoscope " but , I am rather please this cd . <sssss> This cd is designed to make her a star and I do n't blame her or her people for trying . <sssss> R&B ; needs a push right now . <sssss> My favorite songs on this cd are : * Trick me : a country song meets R&B . <sssss> ; * Milkshake : the current hit . <sssss> Funky . <sssss> * In public : I LOVE this song . <sssss> No doubt , its the most sexy song on the cd and should be the second single . <sssss> * Flashback : I believe this song was on the import " Wanderland " and I used to skip over it then , but it is now one of my favorites . <sssss> * Protect my heart : one of my favorite and reminds me of an 80s British song . <sssss> * Millionaire : Kelis should work with Andre 3000 more . <sssss> I love it because its different . <sssss> * Sugar Honey Iced Tea : Favorite song . <sssss> I can hear every era of R&B ; on this track . <sssss> Should be a third single . <sssss> * Stick up : very different . <sssss> But I am not sure what she wanted to do with this one and something tells me , she is not sure . <sssss> But that 's what make the song so special . <sssss> * Marathon : really like this one . <sssss> I really like how it ends . <sssss> Very different . <sssss> I love this cd because its very different . <sssss> Artists like Kelis , Joi and Andre 3000 are the future for R&B . <sssss> ; I think even Erykah Badu sensed a more funky brand of R&B ; on the rise ( which explains her last cd ) . <sssss> Get this cd . <sssss> Its worth it .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B0000AKOMI	4	I first came to knew Kelis as that girl on the Ol' Dirty Bastard tune saying " Hey , Dirty ... baby I got your money , I say Hey , Dirty ... baby I got your money " ! <sssss> I was very curious as to what she had to offer so ... . <sssss> I , like most , probably bought this disc for Milkshake . <sssss> You know , that catchy little song you ca n't get out of your head !?!? <sssss> Well , after I listened , I was a bit shocked ... shocked that the most of the disc was great ! <sssss> There are a few " weak " songs on here , but this disc offers up 14 songs , instead of the normal 10 or 11 we 're used to seeing . <sssss> First of all , the Intro sets the tone of the album : funky , jammin ' and borrows greatly from the disco era . <sssss> The next song , Trick Me , totally BLEW ME AWAY . <sssss> I could not sit still . <sssss> If this song is n't the next release , something is WRONG ! <sssss> Supreme bass line , smokin ' percussion and that funky beat make this the best song on the disc , in my opinion . <sssss> Milkshake was next , need I say more ? <sssss> Then came Keep It Down , which opened with rock guitars . <sssss> I was surprised by this variety . <sssss> The rest of the disc continued to surprise , until I got to the last three songs , Through The Hood , Stick Up and Marathon . <sssss> These three were not my favorite and thought they could have been left off , but that 's just me . <sssss> Bottom line : If you want to " funk it out " , buy this album . <sssss> ...
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B0000AKOMI	5	Kelis ' music has always been tough to categorize . <sssss> Something like Alternative urban might do . <sssss> She 's always kind of reminded me of Bj&ouml;rk . <sssss> ' Trick me ' is the opening track and it 's a delightful bouncy slightly reggae-tinged number , with a throbbing baseline . <sssss> Very catchy . <sssss> The innuendo laden ' Milkshake ' ( Grammy nominated top 3 hit ) with it 's minimalism is also really catchy and reminiscent of ' Nasty girl ' by Vanity 6 . <sssss> Same goes for ' In public ' which features Nas providing a slightly risque rap . <sssss> Raphael ' Nusoul ' Saadiq provides 3 classy numbers , ' Glow ' , ' Attention ' which grabs your attention , and ' Marathon ' which is one of my favorites , with ethereal vocals closing the song , very Massive Attack . <sssss> ' Stick up ' is fantastic , featuring ghostly whistling and humming . <sssss> ' Sugar honey iced tea ' is a fantastic breezy number from the Neptunes , with faint vocoder and Sax . <sssss> ' Keep it down ' is rock laced with heavy beats . <sssss> This is a good cd which grabs you instantly , but gets even better the more you hear it . <sssss> Never a dull moment . <sssss> I hope with this , Kelis finally gets the recognition she deserves .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000AKOMI	1	I Do n't get it ? <sssss> , many people say MILKSHAKE was a disposable single , and that the album was way much better than the leading single ? <sssss> , well maybe MILKSHAKE was a pop crossover that only time will tell if it 's a classic or not , but at least was a hit and one of those songs that goes through your brain and sticks in it , but I have heard this lame album a thousand times from begginning to end , and I do n't have another favorite , only tracks that I personally hate like IN PUBLIC , PROTECT MY HEART , the only song that I could consider the next single would be TRICK ME , but the album it 's really boring and without personality , so sad , because I can tell Kelis is talented , but this album remind us , why there was SINGLES , so you do n't have to buy the whole garbage . <sssss> This album is not good . <sssss> But let see where is next single leading , but hey it 's a month since MILKSHAKE cool down , and stil no sign of anew single , know why ? <sssss> , beacuse the whole rest of the song sux .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B0000AKOMI	5	I already had an idea what Kelis ' " Tasty " was going to sound like before I even put the CD in my player . <sssss> One of the CD booklet photos has Kelis savoring a lollipop , which is positioned in a way that shows that she 's got much more on her mind than the confection she 's enjoying . <sssss> As the photo suggests , we 're in for an album of beat-heavy grooves and lyrics that are almost as sexually frank as anything Prince did back in the day . <sssss> From the first beat on , " Tasty " is sinfully irresistible . <sssss> The Neptunes ( Chad Hugo and Pharell Williams ) do much of the producing on cuts such as the breezy " Flashback " , the single " Milkshake " , and " Sugar Honey Iced Tea " . <sssss> But Kelis works just as well with other producers such as Rockwilder on " In Public " , a catchy jam that 's about doin ' it , well , in public . <sssss> The talented Raphael Saadiq also shines in the laid-back " Glow " , while Andre 3000 of Outkast gives a Prince-inspired groove on " Millionaire " . <sssss> Another great track is " Keep it Down " , a Dallas Austin produced track that has Kelis jamming to a groove that meshes hip hop and amped-up rock . <sssss> " Tasty " is one of the more consistent records I 've heard in 2003 . <sssss> I bought it completely on a whim , and I have yet to regret it .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B0000AKOMI	3	... . <sssss> at issue : is it cool to have little girls mouth the words of something like Milkshake with it 's bearly contained sexuality , just so 's Kelis can jumpstart her career ? <sssss> Or is it a free speech defense ? <sssss> By and large the public will ultimately decide , but for me I 'm getting tired of these singers with marginal talent but big , big visuals selling records . <sssss> Another thing you 'll hear is " Control your kids ' entertainment choices ... " , " Turn off the tee vee , the radio , turn off the CD player " -- a lot of these artists are saying that knowing full and well that they 're on the teevee , etc 24/7/365 ... <sssss> I , however , most certainly will control more . <sssss> If that works to get better work out there for my daughter and the other 12-17 year olds to listen to , you betcha I will . <sssss> Somethings I think require maturity my daughter does n't have yet . 
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B0000C0FKA	5	Joss Stone is becoming one of just a small handful of young UK music acts to break the American market ( and for good reason ) . <sssss> Her voice is powerful , throaty , and oh so SOULFUL . <sssss> For someone so young , it 's truly amazing to hear . <sssss> Think of the days when Ella Fitzgerald , Etta James , Sarah Vaughn , and Nina Simone were in the prime of their careers . <sssss> Joss Stone is a reminder that truly great singers still appear every now and then . <sssss> What a force this young lady is going to be . <sssss> THE SOUL SESSIONS is a fairly short recording ( with only 10 tracks ) but very satisfying indeed . <sssss> Joss ' universal appeal is limitless and will immediately strike a fancy with anyone who hears her rich , decadent vocals . <sssss> This Brit should have a prosperous career for many years to come . <sssss> She may not sing catchy pop tunes , but this is the stuff that real " IDOLS " are made of .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B0000C0FKA	4	Like Whitney Houston , Norah Jones & Christina Aguilera before her , if you did n't see the voice come out of the girl for yourself , then you would n't believe it . <sssss> I was floored when I heard this HUGE voice come out of this petite little girl . <sssss> Soul Sessions is one of those albums that you find accidently , but when you do you fall in love with it and have to tell everyone you know about it . <sssss> All the songs are great , the only two that I never really adapted to were " Some kind of Wonderful " & " All the King 's Horses " . <sssss> " I 've Fallen in Love " & " For the Love of you " are my favorites , but closely following are " Victum of a Foolish Heart " & " Fell in Love with a Boy " . <sssss> This is a great release make sure that you get your hands on a copy .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B0000C0FKA	5	I saw an ad for Joss Stone 's album on a commercial one day , and since I had n't bought any new CDs in a while , I decided to pick it up . <sssss> And it 's a good thing I did . <sssss> The Soul Sessions is a collection of ten " covers " of sorts coming from the strong , soulful voice of a 16-year-old white girl . <sssss> When I said " of sorts " , I meant that the lyrics to the original songs are the same , but the way she sings them ( and sometimes even the tempo of the songs ) are original and different . <sssss> The best songs in my opinion are her takes on Aretha 's " All The King 's Horses " , the Isley 's " For The Love Of You " , and ... well , everything is great . <sssss> Joss even does well on her soul take on The White Stripes ' " Fell In Love With A Girl " ( renamed " Fell In Love With A Boy " , obviously ) . <sssss> Not only are these classic songs covered nicely , but Joss even recruits some legendary artists to help her in the studio - most notably Latimore and Betty Wright . <sssss> And ? <sssss> uestlove also shares production credits . <sssss> In short , I 'll leave you with some good advice : BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A1XX5797TIZT5Q	B0000C0FKA	3	Joss Stone is the real thing in terms of talent . <sssss> There is nothing in her voice that suggests she is all of 16 years old , and her musical direction is also unusual . <sssss> If Stone reminds me of anybody , it is Taylor Dayne , the last great , white , female soul singer I can recall . <sssss> Stone does n't yet have Dayne 's knack for phrasing and light touch , but she certainly has the instrument to build a bright future . <sssss> The songs on The Soul Sessions are not much to write home about . <sssss> Most of the songs lead Stone to scat-sing within the same four-note range , resulting in some cliched passages that could pass for " Soul Singing 101 " . <sssss> Unlike classic soul , the songs here also do n't have enough twists and turns , peaks and valleys , usually staying within the same semi-danceable beats and jazzy arrangements . <sssss> There is n't a single memorable song or lyric , so the lingering signature is Stone 's voice which , while full of potential , is married to unworthy material here . <sssss> Definitely time for a song hunt . <sssss> I 'd be interested in hearing Joss Stone tackle the songs of Laura Nyro , for example . <sssss> Good voices may grab our ears , but it 's good songs that make them last .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B0000C0FKA	4	Joss Stone 's obvious asset is definitely her amazingly soulful voice wise beyond her 16 years of age . <sssss> And the fact that 's gon na play up more than often would be that this girl 's white . <sssss> It 's an innate talent . <sssss> She may not have a whole life behind her but covering classics from the likes of Betty Wright and the Isley Brothers are obviously a breeze to her , a gift to her listeners . <sssss> I especially dig her take on The White Stripes ' Fell In Love With A ( Girl ) which turns the rock song into a soul session of good old loving . <sssss> Another star track is the sensuous Super Duper Love . <sssss> On Some Kind Of Wonderful where she turns up the tempo a little , Joss Stones comes across as relaxed . <sssss> Just the right amount of drama and soul helps this young talented lady stake the right claim without screaming her lungs out like the so-called divas . <sssss> Class act of 2003/4 .
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B0000C0FKA	4	Joss Stone - The Soul Sessions ( S-Curve , 2003 ) Yeah , she 's 16 , she 's white , and she 's from England , but she also got soul . <sssss> This album is a near-classic , full of respectable remakes . <sssss> Not many people can remake " All the King 's Horses " by Aretha Franklin but Joss did a good job . <sssss> And the way she flipped " For the Love of You " was awesome ( note how she added in there , " All we need is candlelights / And a D'ANGELO song " ; game recognize game ) . <sssss> However , Ms. Stone does a lot of screamin ' . <sssss> Dang girl , just sing the song !! <sssss> This album reminds me of Monica 's first album , Miss Thang , where Monica was doing so many vocal gymnastics , thus trying so hard to show us that although she was young , she can still sing . <sssss> Then her second album , The Boy Is Mine , followed and she had a more mellow sound . <sssss> Hopefully Joss 's voice will mature the same way with her next release . <sssss> - EJR
A3I675GA2O8I59	B0000C0FKA	5	The complex mature vocals of 16 year old JOSS STONE are amazing . <sssss> Plus the musical production on this CD is wonderful reaching for a higher standard and sound when compared to the current standards on the POP CHARTS . <sssss> This CD is a tribute to the sound of great 70s soulmusic . <sssss> I do n't want to go on and on about the glories of this CD . <sssss> You 'll have to simply download the two free tracks available on AMAZON and make up your mind . <sssss> However , I 'm sure you 'll want to purchase this CD .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0000C0FKA	5	Just when I was thinking that I had to wait till December for a " must buy " cd - Alicia Keys , here comes Joss . <sssss> I was a little skeptical when I saw a brief clip of Joss on MTV but after hearing her sing live on GMA , I rushed to order her cd and am not disappointed . <sssss> Her voice is beautiful and I love a recent quote of hers when asked why she does n't just sing pop music since she looks like a pop star . <sssss> She replied " I do n't like pop music . If I tried to sing it , it would not be real " . <sssss> YOU GO GIRL !! <sssss> After a summer of bland r & b/pop , it is soooo refreshing to hear a new artist with such great music . <sssss> I wish her all the success in the world and ca n't wait till she releases another album .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B0000C0FKA	5	Joss Stone was ready to record an album that would have put her on the same path as other teenage singers like Britney Spears . <sssss> Instead she heard and fell in love with classic American soul music by the likes of Betty Wright . <sssss> Soul Sessions is the fruit of that love and it is a remarkable vocal showcase . <sssss> Her inspiration , Betty Wright , ends up producing seven of the tracks . <sssss> The songs are mostly little known soul nuggets . <sssss> Ms Stone is still young and a bit raw , but she shows a lot power with her voice . <sssss> She can be rough and hard on a song like " Victim Of A Foolish Heart " but then lace it with a bit a sugar to balance it out . <sssss> Soul legends , guitarist Little Beaver and pianist Latimore add some down and gritty work . <sssss> Little Beaver 's playing on the fabulous " The Chokin ' Kind " is a reckless , soulful force . <sssss> His funky riffs interact with Latimore 's slinky piano perfectly to set up a growling vocal from Ms. Stone on " Dirty Man " . <sssss> uestlove from the Roots provides the album 's best production on a funky reworking of The White Stripes ' " Fell In Love With A Girl " . <sssss> Ms. Stone 's version , with the title changed to reflect the singer 's gender , takes the song from a guitar-drums rock song into a funk-soul burner . <sssss> The song becomes Ms. Stone 's and she 's on fire throughout the track . <sssss> The album closes on a soft and beautiful note with the heartbreaking " For The Love Of You " . <sssss> Ms. Stone has show on her first album that she can come up with the goods to emulate her favorite singers on cover songs , but work them in a way to make them her own . <sssss> This Japanese import version contains one extra track , " The Player " which is another excellent burner of cover of The First Choice .
A31U2QT7SAL7K	B0000C0FKA	4	One ca n't possibly improve on the previous reviews that are praiseworthy of Stone 's freshman release . <sssss> All that I can add is that it 's time for racial comparison to be a thing of the past in music . <sssss> What does it mean to sound " black " ? <sssss> Or to sound " white " ? <sssss> To use such labeling is to limit the bounds to which music can be experienced . <sssss> I yearn for a time when there are no musical categories and polarized tastes , a time when the merit of the artist is based solely on his / her skills , not so much his / her skin color . <sssss> With the number of reviews posted here that mention Stone 's ethnicity , I see that that time has yet to arrive . <sssss> The BOTTOM LINE : The girl can sing , the album is well-produced , and it deserves a place in your CD player !
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B0000C0FKA	1	I was tortured by a female friend with this awful piece of dreck on a long car ride recently . <sssss> She hyped this CD to the point of likening Joss Stone 's debut to second coming of Teena Marie and that 's an insult ! <sssss> Every note sang and played on this LP is is phony , overblown , pretentious and downright irritating . <sssss> Caterwauling endlessly about your man , your heart and the blues ( how rough has her life been for a 16 year old ? <sssss> ) does n't make for great entertainment and Stone 's over the top performances make this sound like a parody or satire on the blues rather than the real thing . <sssss> Horrible , just horrible !
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B0000C6E4D	4	This might be blasphemous to hard-core Sarah fans , but I actually like this album better than her previous releases . <sssss> Ok ... so maybe it 's tied with " Surfacing " but I enjoy it more than " Fumbling Towards Ecstasy " . <sssss> Sarah had quite a job on her hands with following up 1997 's " Surfacing " which was the biggest album of her career and thrust her into the main stream . <sssss> I 've heard a lot of negativity about " Afterglow " but I happen to feel that is an awesome album . <sssss> Of course , it 's very mellow but most of her music is . <sssss> " Fallen " is the opening track and was her first single . <sssss> It got moderate radio airplay at AC and pop radio and is a beautiful track . <sssss> " World On Fire " was what I was hoping to be the second single , but " Stupid " was picked . <sssss> " Stupid " is a good song , but " World On Fire " has a much better quality to it and very good production . <sssss> " Train Wreck " is also in the same vein as " World On Fire " with a soft vocal and hushed backing vocals . <sssss> The other two highlights occur at the end of the album and those are " Perfect Girl " and " Dirty Little Secret " . <sssss> " Perfect Girl " has a nice melody , but the lyrics are very good too and " Dirty Little Secret " is reminicent of " Do What You Have To Do " from " Surfacing " . <sssss> Both are gorgeous piano ballads . <sssss> This album may disappoint some upon first listen , but be sure to give it another try . <sssss> It might take some getting used to , but it 's a very beautiful recording . <sssss> Sarah is truly a very gifted songwriter .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B0000C6E4D	5	The first time I heard this CD , it did n't blow me away like her other albums have . <sssss> I kept listening to it over and over , and having allowed the album to sink in , it is now one of my favorite CDs . <sssss> Sarah is one of my favorite singers , and she never disappoints . <sssss> The CD only has 10 songs , but with Sarah , it 's quality , not quantity , that matters .1 ) Fallen - the first single . <sssss> A great way to kick off this album .2 ) World on Fire - the lyrics are really good . <sssss> They really make you think .3 ) Stupid - probably my favorite song on the album . <sssss> It is impossible to not feel this song . <sssss> The emotion Sarah conveys is too strong for that .4 ) Drifting - a really good song . <sssss> The lyrics really hit home to me .5 ) Train Wreck - another terrific song . <sssss> Who has n't felt this way before ? <sssss> 6 ) Push - one of my favorite songs on the album . <sssss> It is just so good and real .7 ) Answer - another really good song . <sssss> Sarah really sounds good here .8 ) Time - a terrific song . <sssss> The lyrics are very strong and thought-provoking . <sssss> 9 ) Perfect Girl - one of my favorites . <sssss> This song is a perfect fit for Sarah 's great voice .10 ) Dirty Little Secret - a great way to end the album . <sssss> She leaves you wanting more , which is always a good thing . <sssss> This album is very good . <sssss> Since it will undoubtedly be a while before Sarah 's next album , it 's a good thing she has given us an album as good as this to pacify her many fans . <sssss> I think she should put out a greatest hits album . <sssss> If anyone deserves it , it 's her .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B0000C6E4D	4	Afterglow by Sarah McLachlan is surprisely moving and wonderfully produced . <sssss> I am not normally a McLachlan super-fan but some of her songs before this album are quite engaging . <sssss> I decided to give this album a chance , standout tracks include : Time , Perfect Girl , Dirty Little Secret , Stupid , and Answer . <sssss> Sarah 's voice has improved and her lyrics are at its strongest . <sssss> I could listen to the track , Time all day long , it sucks you in after the first 20 seconds , amazing ! <sssss> So whether you hate or love her , Afterglow will have you bathed in it for awhile . <sssss> Enjoy !
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B0000C6E4D	4	I just picked up Sarah McLachlan 's latest album , and it 's great . <sssss> Yet I 'm not exactly sure why the album is called Afterglow , because for the most part the lyrics are kind of dark , which is a little obvious with titles like " Fallen " , " World On Fire " , and " Train Wreck " . <sssss> In fact , speculation started that there may be problems in her marriage with fellow percussionist Ashwin Sood . <sssss> But that does n't mean this album is worth skipping - far from it , in fact . <sssss> What could be the album 's best song is " Push " , which is a smooth declaration to her man complete with nice background vocals . <sssss> But the Grammy-nominated " Fallen " is n't far behind . <sssss> And " Time " and " Dirty Little Secret " are great pensive tales . <sssss> I said this MIGHT be Sarah 's best album only because I did n't hear all of her old stuff . <sssss> But this is still a great recording . <sssss> Like I said before , most of the songs are dark in subject matter , but the songs are still captivating and less boring than , say , Beck 's Sea Change ( sorry , I tried my best to like that album ) . <sssss> All comparisons aside , Afterglow is a tremendous album that I should have picked up sooner . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B0000C6E4D	4	The American buying public remains in this day and age that most fickle of animals , and many artists react with the changing times in order to keep up with their ever-changing audiences ' tastes . <sssss> So I guess we can give Sarah McLachlan at least a little credit -- she has n't changed one bit in the ensuing six years since she hit big with SURFACING and the accompanying Lilith Fair extravanganza , staying the course with her now trademark brand of ethereal folk-pop . <sssss> AFTERGLOW sounds like it could have been recorded at the same time as SURFACING -- or SOLACE or FUMBLING TOWARDS ECSTACY , for that matter . <sssss> So it 's safe to say that McLachlan does n't do the musical makeover that old colleagues Jewel and Liz Phair have undergone with recent efforts . <sssss> The fact that she breaks no new ground becomes moot the minute she unleashes that glorious wonder of a voice -- in a time when female singers sound either mechanical ( J. <sssss> Lo or Britney ) or overwrought ( Christina ) , McLachlan 's soprano remains an instrument of unfettered purity . <sssss> It 's further helped by the fact that she 's got a pretty swell batch of tunes this go-round -- highlights being the unjustly ignored first single " Fallen " , the 911-driven " World On Fire " , and the emotional whirlwind " Train Wreck " . <sssss> In the end , AFTERGLOW reaffirms McLachlan 's continued relevance in an everchanging musical world .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B0000C6E4D	5	" Afterglow " is Sarah McLachlan 's first studio album in six years . <sssss> Such quality heard on this album makes it worth the long wait . <sssss> She proves that she 's evolved a lot in her music since " Surfacing " . <sssss> Every track showcases her beautiful soprano voice . <sssss> Her guitar and piano playing live up to her voice . <sssss> She writes every song lyric from her heart , which is showcases wonderfully . <sssss> Her range of music genres allow her to express such deep emotions more thoroughly . <sssss> She combines pop , easy listening , and rock . <sssss> " Fallen " , her latest hit , is a great album starter . <sssss> " Stupid " explores her rock side at her edgiest while never losing her musical quality . <sssss> " Dirty Little Secret " shows her intimate side , similar to " Angel " ( from " Surfacing " ) , by featuring only her voice and her piano . <sssss> " Afterglow " is one of the best releases of 2003 . <sssss> This is a great pleaser for those wanting to listen to a quality artist . <sssss> **** Expect a 2003 Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Performance for " Fallen " . <sssss> Also , expect a 2004 nomination for Best Pop Album . <sssss> ( The single was released before the deadline date [ 9-30-03 ] , and the album was released after . <sssss> That 's why the years are different . <sssss> )
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B0000C6E4D	5	Sarah 's return from hiatus has produced her most understated work yet . <sssss> Afterglow feels significantly less produced than her previous efforts , but her style has amazingly stayed unchanged in the world of hip hop fashion and stunts . <sssss> From 1993 's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy to 1997 's Surfacing and Afterglow in 2003 , Sarah has largely pursued her music in the same low-key direction but never sounding dated at any instance . <sssss> The first single Fallen follows most in the vein of her past songs , like Building A Mystery . <sssss> A nice slow-rock song that echoes of a crestfallen soul . <sssss> My favorites on this album will have to be Answer , Train Wreck and Dirty Little Secret . <sssss> Answer , in itself , is a song about being there for someone you hold dear and thes sentimentality and raw emotions conveyed through Sarah 's soothing voice is worth the price of the CD itself . <sssss> Train Wreck features some of the best lyrics on this album and Dirty Little Secret makes for a perfect closer to the album . <sssss> This album may come across as being more subdued but it has successfully conveyed Sarah 's happiness in the afterglow of her mum 's death and her daughter 's birth through Sarah 's good delivery . <sssss> I hope we wo n't have to wait another 6 years for more . <sssss> Along with Annie Lennox 's Bare , this is one of my favorite albums of the year .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B0000C6E4D	5	Wow ... . <sssss> the pictures inside the cd jacket are worth the price alone ! <sssss> What happened to Sarah ? <sssss> She certainly has gotten sexier over the past 6 years ! <sssss> She is looking really beautiful now with the long hair . <sssss> Beyond that , this album is really well done . <sssss> It 's like a continuation of SURFACING ... and that is a great thing ! <sssss> SURFACING is one of Sarah 's best albums and the fact that she did n't change her sound drastically between outings is greatness to her fan 's ears . <sssss> All of the songs on here are really good ... . <sssss> I really did n't feel there were any real standouts . <sssss> You just need to get this one .... . <sssss> Sarah is something special . <sssss> Do n't miss out on her ! <sssss> You 'll be sorry !
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B0000C6E4D	4	The fifth cd from Sarah McLachlan is fairly similar to 1997 's " Surfacing " and 1993 's " Fumbling Towards Ecstacy " . <sssss> This is what McLachlan does best -- creating moody and introspective numbers ranging from the mid-tempo " Fallen " , " Stupid " , " Perfect Girl " to the more uptempo classics " World On Fire " and " Train Wreck " . <sssss> This seems to be the same pattern she followed on " Surfacing " . <sssss> The work on " Afterglow " is mature and thoughtful , something I can leave in my cd player all the time . <sssss> It does n't take great musical risks , but it delivers memorable and powerful music . <sssss> I would have given this cd five stars , but I do n't feel that it overshadows " Fumbling Towards Ecstacy " , which I think to be McLachlan 's finest hour . <sssss> I would like to see her take more musical risks in the future because she 's already proven she can do the type of music on " Afterglow " extremely well .
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B0000C6E4D	2	Too boring to ever really loathe , McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years , but the compendium is always the same - dull songs , listless vocals , uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement . <sssss> Nothing here as breathtaking as ` Ben 's Song ' or ` Possession ' or ` Do What You Have To Do ' , but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded ` Angel ' and ` Into The Fire ' and ` Solace ' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon . <sssss> She might or might not be a hack , but if she is , she 's a fancy hack . <sssss> My grade : C +
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B0000C6E4D	5	Sarah McLachlan always takes her time between albums , and this time it was no exception . <sssss> AFTERGLOW , her newest album , comes 6 years after her critically acclaimed SURFACING album was released . <sssss> In between there were two albums released , a remix compilation and a live album . <sssss> AFTERGLOW was worth the wait . <sssss> " Fallen " is an excellent first single , and overall song . <sssss> This has the makings to become a Sarah McLachlan classic ( which in my opinion it already has ) . <sssss> The lyrics are honest , pure and deep , and straight to the point . <sssss> " Stupid " is the new single , and yes it 's another relatable track . <sssss> However my favorite track is " Train Wreck " . <sssss> The lyrics , combined with the flow of the music in the song , makes it accessible and automatically a standout . <sssss> Hopefully it will see a single release . <sssss> " World On Fire " is a nice ballad with an interesting perspective about the world today . <sssss> Other highlights include " Time " , " Dirty Little Secret " , " Drifting " , and " Answer " . <sssss> Well worth the wait !
A14U40MX3CPO8Q	B0000C6E4D	4	Sarah McLachlan 's latest offering , 2003 's ' Afterglow ' , features more of the same blandness featured on her 1997 blockbuster album ' Surfacing ' . <sssss> Only this time it is n't nearly as good , but it 's still good enough for me to recommend it . <sssss> Teaming up yet again with her longtime producer Pierre Marchand , McLachlan offers fans what could be described as ' Surfacing Lite ' . <sssss> While ' Surfacing ' did suffer from a few bad songs , McLachlan 's lyrics were at least more heartfelt than anything that 's on this record . <sssss> You know Sarah is running out of ideas when she comes up with trite lyrics like " there are times I ca n't decide when I ca n't tell up from down " and " 'cause I 'm a train wreck waiting to happen / waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks " . <sssss> Despite a few corny lyrics and some boring arrangements , ' Afterglow ' is a good album even if it offers nothing new from Sarah . <sssss> I just hope that in another six years ( or even longer ) she 'll release an album that 's truly worth waiting for .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B0000C6E4D	3	Let me set the record straight ( here I go again ) : I used to own ( no longer ) three of Sarah 's albums , namely " Fumbling ... " , " Surfacing " and " Mirrorball " . <sssss> After a while not having heard any music from her , I figured I 'd check this one out . <sssss> I was sure that she must have evolved somehow . <sssss> Well , I did n't find much evolution in her work . <sssss> I ca n't say it was bad as some reviewers argue , but for the most part ( perhaps with the exception of the closing track , which I was VERY impressed with ) the album felt bland and as if it had been recorded five years ago : that is , it felt just like her previous works . <sssss> Overall , it lacked musical evolution which is unfortunate considering the time she was away from the studio , but it 's the truth . <sssss> Though I would n't say to stay away from it altogether ( for example , I 'd stick with Sarah a thousand times more than with Norah Jones ) , I do n't think I 'd recommend it either . <sssss> There 's way too much interesting music out there , that you just need to listen to if you feel Sarah Mclachlan is the best thing on earth . <sssss> I leave you with a few such recommendations for you to try out . <sssss> For some lesser known artists , try ' Lost in Translation ' [ SOUNDTRACK ] , Air 's ' Talkie Walkie ' and Jacqui Naylor . <sssss> And if you are more inclined to sticking to the mainstream , listen to Nelly Furtado 's or John Mayer 's latest , or Maroon 5 , for a change . <sssss> All of these are people who are trying new things .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B0000C6E4D	5	Wow , is of course the only word that can descibe the ethereal euphoria that McLachlan creates in her beautiful ablum . <sssss> The six year break that she took after Surfacing was certainly an emotional roller coaster for her , with the death of her mother and the time with her child , but it yielded wonderful results . <sssss> Again the music is haunting and mystical , but it takes an even deeper detour that was skipped in previous works . <sssss> Love is portrayed in a " dark place " and life is cast in a blue , hazy light . <sssss> McLachlan gives us a look into a dimension of conscience that few writers are able to bless us with . <sssss> She is proof that it does n't take " an album a year " to stay beloved by the public , and truely she only gets better with time .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000C6E4D	3	Afterglow , is the return of Sarah McLachlan to music after more than 4 years of vacation . <sssss> One thing is unmistakeble , McLachlan 's has an angel voice , it 's just atmospheric . <sssss> But with " Afterglow " it seems she 's still trapped in 1998 , there is no innovation on this album , she could easily have fitted all the tracks in " Surfacing " , that 's why some people do n't playe dit at radio , " Fallen " sounded like Sarah 's all released hits . <sssss> Only with different lyrics , it 's obvious that McLachlan paid attention to the old said " stick to the formula " , but somehow after two superb album 's , the third is enough , I wanted to hear a new venue like Jewel 's 0304 , ok she got little to pop-new wave , but at least she tried , but this could be put on the cd , along with Sarah 's previous two albums , and you would n't tell wich song is newer than the other , if your not a fan . <sssss> So this album is in no way bad , is just the same stuff as always , I think that it 's why this album has n't make that much buzz .
AADJXNY9HSKJF	B0000DD7LC	3	I love Alicia Keys . <sssss> She 's very talented and has an obvious talent for piano and songwriting . <sssss> Her radio singles are always strong and great R&B ; / soul songs . <sssss> Her albums are a mixed bag , though . <sssss> " The Diary " has the same problem as her debut . <sssss> Both start off with a punch , but just grow tiring and repetitive halfway through . <sssss> The first half of this album is awesome . <sssss> " Harlem 's Nocturne " is a cool opening . <sssss> " Karma " and " Heartburn " are catchy R&B ; songs and I love the medley of " If I Was Your Woman / Walk on By " . <sssss> The first single " You Do n't Know My Name " definitely catches yoour ear with its retro soul vibe . <sssss> The real stand-out is by far her soul ballad " IF I Ai n't Got You " which was one of the best singles of the past year . <sssss> She sounds flawless on it . <sssss> " Diary " was also very good , but after it , you ca n't help but start to tune out . <sssss> The rest of the songs run together and are hard to enjoy . <sssss> " When You Really Love Someone " is ok , but it kind of similar to her 2001 breakthrough " Fallen " . <sssss> This is a decent purchase from an outstanding artist , but be prepared for some outstanding soul cuts and some downright typical , boring R&B ; .

A2FL41BCS486E8	B0000DD7LC	5	I absolutely love this cd . <sssss> Her first cd was n't very good ; only 3 good songs , but this is simply incredible . <sssss> All of the songs stand out . <sssss> The best part is that they are different from one another . <sssss> If I have to pick a favorite song , it will be " Karma " , although all the others are excellent too . <sssss> I just wish she would have included " Streets of New York " , but that 's record bussiness . <sssss> Buy this album ; you wo n't regret it .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B0000DD7LC	3	One listen to " You Do n't Know my Name " and you can clearly see that Alicia Keys has narrowly side stepped the sophomore slump with The Diary of Alicia Keys . <sssss> The album showcases her undeniable love for smooth , old-school soul as well as classical piano instrumentals which make her sound so unique among the artists in the industry today . <sssss> Despite her undeniable talents , she lacks the charisma & bluesy sounds that artists like Erykah Badu & Jill Scott have already mastered . <sssss> And while the album is indeed a pretty thorough listen , it does n't have the type of songs that made her debut so damn likeable , such as " Trouble " , " Goodbye " & " Why Do I Feel So Sad " . <sssss> In its favor , songs such as the pulsating " Karma " & her incredible cover of Gladys Knight 's " If I Was Your Woman " are greatest hits worthy . <sssss> Elsewhere on the album , she dwindles into mediocrity on such songs as " Diary " & " Dragon Days " , but impressively recovers with the oddly titled " Samsonite Man " & " Nobody not Really " . <sssss> I hate to strattle the fence , but while their are key errors that cease the apportunity for the album to be dubbed flawless , Alicia proves herself as an amazing artist one with so much potential its haunting . <sssss> If she combined the best songs from both albums and releases them together in the form of a recorded live collection , I think that she would finally achieve the perfect album that she is trying to attain . <sssss> I 'm intrested in seeing where her career will take her and I 'm stamping this one as an early favorite to dominate the 2004 Grammy awards .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B0000DD7LC	5	Those who thought " Songs In A-Minor " is amazing have only heard the beginning . <sssss> Many thought that its high quality could never be matched or beat . <sssss> " The Diary of Alicia Keys " beats it . <sssss> These tracks , which were written from her heart , account her personal thoughts and trials through the last two years of her life . <sssss> Her powerful words are song amazing soulful , forcing listeners to feel what she 's singing . <sssss> Such quality proves that she 's close to Aretha Franklin 's level . <sssss> Her piano playing is equally amazing , further expressing her words . <sssss> Her combination of Motown R&B and modern day upbeats offer a unique and unmistakable sound with her songwriting . <sssss> Compared to " Songs In A-Minor " , her slightly more full sound , by adding a couple extra instruments , offer the added distinction . <sssss> In a time when mainstream music is released only to make money , Alicia Keys represents and gives hope to true musicians . <sssss> Obviously , she only performs because music is her passion . <sssss> This may be why her songs are much better than everyone else 's . <sssss> Her talents are delivered in a variety of ways in this album : love , loneliness , sassiness , and more . <sssss> Regardless if she 's singing ballads or upbeat songs , she never flaws a single note . <sssss> Her hit single " You Do n't Know My Name " capitalizes her musical evolution within the past two years . <sssss> " The Diary of Alicia Keys " proves that there will be no artist like Alicia Keys . <sssss> She states with her musical quality that she 'll be around for a long time . <sssss> This album will be a classic . <sssss> This is sure to please many listeners . <sssss> *** Expect Alicia Keys to receive at least six Grammy nominations for 2004 , including Album of the Year . <sssss> She deserves them all . <sssss> She could possibly repeat her five Grammy wins for 2001 .
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B0000DD7LC	3	( 3 1 / 2 stars ) Though I gave her first album a 4 , Alicia Keys bypasses the sophomore jinx with this album ( although so many people wanted to see her fail this time around ) . <sssss> I liked " You Do n't Know My Name " but it is so overplayed ( like all of Alicia Keys ' singles ) that I just skip it while I play the album ( moreover , the way she keeps saying , " baby , baby , ba-BY " , starts to sound annoying ) . <sssss> " If I Ai n't Got You " is also a great song and " Diary " featuring Tony Toni Ton&eacute; has great production . <sssss> The promo song , " Streets of New York " featuring Nas and Rakim is supposed to be on here , but I 'm glad it 's not because the song is awful . <sssss> There are also a few flaws like the " butchering a classic " moment , " If I Was Your Woman " over the Issac Hayes ' " Walk On By " sample . <sssss> At times self-indulgent , Alicia shows that she has talent , even though I do n't know if it 's worth all the praise that she 's getting . <sssss> Alicia 's almost there : if she stops all that screaming and actually write some more mature songs , by album three she 'll be ready for diva status . <sssss> - EJR
A3I675GA2O8I59	B0000DD7LC	5	Believe it or not , this CD is better than her previous work . <sssss> ALICIA clearly masters the " keys " ingredients to create a meaningfull moment in music ( vocals , musicianship ) . <sssss> The tracks on DIARY such as YOU DO N'T KNOW MY NAME blend the attitude of 60s soul with current production standards . <sssss> Titles such as FEELING YOU FEELING ME allow fans to pay close attention to her musicianship . <sssss> " SO SIMPLE " is a track paying tribute to a Stevie Wonder vibe while the sultry " DRAGON DAYS " honors the legendary ISAAC HAYES groove . <sssss> " KARMA " could easily be remixed leading to a massive club hit ( strong BEYONCE feel on KARMA ) . <sssss> Most songs on DIARY will remind listeners of the classic song styles of the late 1960s or early 1970s . <sssss> A cleaver change of pace and revamped sound for Ms.KEYS.Her vocals on this project are less " in your face " and are produced to compliment the music . <sssss> This is one of the best releases from a true artist during 2003 . <sssss> A must have cd for any fans of POP or R/B .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0000DD7LC	5	I got this album the day it was released and wondered like a lot of her fans , if Alicia could top SIAM and go diamond but distance and perspective have made me realize that diamond status of an album does not mean good music was produced because as we all know , plenty of mediocre and less than mediocre " singers " / entertainers or whatever they call themselves are selling enough albums to go platinum . <sssss> A year later , the only songs that I still really do n't like are Wake Up & Samsonite Man . <sssss> Wake Up has a nice beat / production and message but ... not one of my favs . <sssss> Otherwise the album is a solid hit - the standouts are the trifeckta : You Do n't Know My Name , If I Ai n't Got You & Diary . <sssss> The placement of these three songs back to back to back is incredible - all three are love songs that touched my heart and I never tire of listening to them . <sssss> I heard a lot of people complain that her speaking interlude in YDKMN was corny but it was a sweet throwback to the days when a breakdown was required in any love song . <sssss> The other standouts to me are : Karma , Harlem 's Noc , So Simple , Heartburn and Nobody Not Really . <sssss> Karma & Heartburn certainly surprised me with the funk factor - both are extremely catchy , fun songs that I love to hear and see her perform because I think they allow her to step out from behind the piano . <sssss> Rounding out my faves are : Dragon Days , Feelin U Feelin Me - interesting interlude , wished it could 've gone on longer & her remake of If I Was Your Woman / Walk on By . <sssss> Overall I give this an A + as a step up from SIAM - an excellent sophomore set from an artist who I expect to write / produce a album as important in the musical world as Stevie Wonder 's Songs In The Key of Life one day .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B0000DD7LC	4	I was a little disappointed with this . <sssss> Her voice is still wonderful and she still uses the piano to great effect on some songs , but she also started letting too many other people have control of the music , and because of that , this album turns out to be more of a mess than her debut . <sssss> I 'll still give it four stars because " If I Ai n't Got You " is a definite masterpiece , but Alicia needs to take more control over what goes into her albums , and what ever producer or other person led her into the sinful land of sampling needs to lead her right back out . <sssss> She has too much talent to be ruining her music like that .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0000DD7LC	3	On the second go round Alicia gives you more melody and grove and less instrumentation . <sssss> This isnt a bad thing except for the fact that it leaves something missing that the first cd had . <sssss> Something that I think helped to seperate her from the other artists out there now . <sssss> Still this cd is a solid cd and manages to rise above the norm on a few cuts . <sssss> On this cd she really keeps it retro and old school , however giving it the lyrical up-to-date feel of fresh lyrics . <sssss> " You dont know my name " is easily one of the best tracks and makes me wonder why Kayne West didnt do more songs with her for this cd . <sssss> ( Hopefully he will make it more times around on the third ) Her intro reminds me of the the one from the first while still keeping it somewhat fresh in delivery . <sssss> As for the rest of the cd ... whats good ? <sssss> : * Heartburn * You dont know my name * If I aint got you * Diary * Wake up * Streets of New York * When you really Love someoneThese tracks right here are the highlights of the album that I was feeling . <sssss> With a Strong debut week of 618 , 000 copies sold she has no sophomore jinx here . <sssss> Just off the strength of " You dont know my name " Im sure she could release a single . <sssss> ( if it inst released already ) Overall I enjoyed the cd and thought it was a solid note for this time around . <sssss> Hopefully next time around she can combine what she had on her last cd mixed with this to create Ultimate Alicia Keys but until then this will have to do . <sssss> Get it !
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B0000DD7LC	3	First of all , Alicia really got some talent . <sssss> Good on the piano , good voice , she produced most of the album herself too . <sssss> There 's a wide range of variety here , slow jams , soulful songs and uptempo stuff . <sssss> The hit single " You do n't know my name " got a old school sound , it 's nice , but especially the music . <sssss> " Diary " with Tony ! <sssss> Toni ! <sssss> Tone ! <sssss> is really beautiful , also " Karma " is . <sssss> Soiulish " If i was your woman " also fit in well into this album . <sssss> For those that like faster songs with funky beats check Timbaland song " Heartburn " . <sssss> This album is pretty personal and it 's beautiful to listen to aswell . <sssss> A few songs are pretty boring and could have been excluded , more uptempo songs please ! <sssss> I would say it 's more beautiful than fun , not that many real hit singles , you simple need to play it til you like them . <sssss> For my taste this is allright , could have expected more but it 's a decent album .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B0000DD7LC	4	A much better album than her last cd , " Songs of A Minor " . <sssss> But Alicia still needs to push herself to be more original and not repeat styles from yesteryear . <sssss> Do n't me wrong , I love this cd but I get the feeling that I 've heard this before from my 70s soul collection . <sssss> Also when you consider the fact that artists like Andre 3000 , R. Kelly , Erykah Badu , Kelis and Joi are taking the lessons of old soul and expanding it in another direction , Alicia comes off as dated . <sssss> She ca n't survive rehashing old ideas . <sssss> Soon , she will be compare to Lenny K. ( who does the same thing with rock music ) . <sssss> Alicia is at her best when she 's writing from a personal situation . <sssss> Songs like " Diary " and " Nobody not Really " are real gems . <sssss> Her attempt at being ' different ' falls flat . <sssss> Songs like " So Simple " and " Karma " just do n't impress me too much . <sssss> But I give her respect for trying . <sssss> In other words , Miss Keys needs to continue to grow because until then , I will never consider her a great artist . <sssss> Until then , I will continue to listen to my Minnie Riperton cds .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B0000DD7LC	2	Clive Davis is Good at finding Material for Artists He works with . <sssss> you can tell He Pre-dated the Cult-Classic Film " The Idol-Maker " . <sssss> Alicia Keys is Vastly Overrated & Creates Soul Muzak Re-Makes & patches at best . <sssss> Yeah She can Play but still ai n't wrote One Original Song yet . <sssss> Vocally She ai n't gon na Scare Christina anytime soon nor Beyonce . <sssss> some of the Material here is cool but when you hear what Monica is doing with Missy & also Ashanti 's " Rain On Me " what exactly Seperates Alicia Keys from them but Her Piano Playing ? <sssss> Alicia has followed Mariah Carey & Mary J. BLiege 's Blue-Print at taking Older Cuts & Re-dressing them up. <sssss> Ak is trying to reach the depth that Lauyrn Hill had but it 's not coming out Natural but Her & Clive have a Formula that works .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B0000DD7LC	4	Keys continues to shine with her sophomore effort , " The Diary of Alicia Keys " . <sssss> I was starting to worry since it had been quite a while since we 've heard from her in solo format , but she 's come through again ... a bit softer and a bit more reflective . <sssss> The disc starts out with Harlem 's Nocturne , which I swear was left off " Songs In A Minor " , it mirrors that material to a T . <sssss> Then comes ( a tie ) my favorite track , Karma . <sssss> Such wicked strings , vocal harmonies and underlying beat ... not to mention great lyrics and performance by Keys . <sssss> The other track ( favorite tie ) is If I Was Your Woman / Walk On By . <sssss> You can describe this track in one word : soulful , just check out the bass line - smoothness ! <sssss> Another standout was If I Ai n't Got You , a nice jam. <sssss> I was a bit shocked / surprised after a full listen that You Do n't Know My Name was selected as the debut single . <sssss> It 's ok , but far from the best song or material on this disc . <sssss> One track that really got on my nerves was Heartburn , track 3 . <sssss> This song was not in synch with the rest of recording , but oh well . <sssss> This is a solid release and should score her a few Top 10 singles . <sssss> The magic is still there ... there 's just not as much of it .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B0000DD7LC	5	A masterpiece , superior to its predecessor which , do n't get me wrong was very good . <sssss> There is a relaxed , breezy feel to the whole cd , and the songs catch you instantly . <sssss> The lead off single ' You do n't know my name ' is a brilliant song ( co penned with Kanye West ) , reminiscent of classic 70s soul , complete with a spoken word section . <sssss> In fact , the whole cd sounds like classics from the 70s , amazing to find that all but one of the songs are penned or co penned by Keys . <sssss> On ' If I aint got you ' , ' If I was your woman ' ( an excellent remake by the way ) and ' When you really love someone ' , she sings with a raspy growl seeping with passion , akin to Mary J bilge . <sssss> Shock horror on seeing her work with Timbaaland ( do n't get me wrong , I love Timbaaland , but did n't think his futuristic funk would fit Alicia 's smooth retro soul ) , but the result is the lovely retro funk of ' Heartburn ' . <sssss> All she needs now is an afro . <sssss> ' So simple ' is simply fab and is my favourite , with delicate piano tinklings sprinkled throughout . <sssss> ' Dragon days ' is a corker , ' Diary ' , ' Samsonite man ' , the lovely interlude ' Feeling U , feeling me ' , and the jazzy ' Nobody , not really ' are superb . <sssss> Another good point , averaging 4 minutes , no song overstays its welcome ( exception , ' You do n't know my name ' which needs all of its 6 minutes 6 seconds to weave its magic ) . <sssss> There were few soul cds released in 2003 which can dream of coming close to this soon-to-be-classic . <sssss> Awesome !! 
AE31M52VLKOG6	B0000DD7LC	5	Grammy Award Winner Alicia Keys is back with a strong sophomore effort . <sssss> I love the way she phrases the lyrics in her songs . <sssss> She sings about the different aspects of being in love so well . <sssss> Her voice is smooth , sexy and soulful . <sssss> My favorite song on this album is You Do n't Know My Name , because I like the idea of a woman making the first move on a man she really likes . <sssss> I love the way Alicia sings the track Heartburn . <sssss> This song has a lot of energy , and it made me want to move around and dance . <sssss> Diary is another stand out track in my opinion . <sssss> It is a great song about having someone in your life who you can trust to tell your secrets and is loyal to you. <sssss> I also loved the song If I Aint Got You . <sssss> I think this song is a reminder that material things do n't really bring you lasting satisfaction and The only thing that matters in life is having someone to love . <sssss> Slow Down is an excellent song about trying to slow down in a relationship and getting to know the person you are attracted to . <sssss> I really enjoyed listening Diary of Alicia Keys . <sssss> She is a true talent who will be around for many years .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000DD7LC	5	Alicia Keys surpasses her successful debut album with this well done music project . <sssss> In all aspects this album is way better than her debut . <sssss> I like to make simple reviews so the best tracks in this album are the leading single " You Do n't Know My Name " a truth that it 's close to many people like I , " If I Ai n't Got You " a tune so personal , so soulful , the best according to my taste , such a classic , " Karma " upbeat ! <sssss> such a great tune , " If I was Your Woman / Walk ON By " wow ! <sssss> this is one of the best cover ever done ... , " Heartburn " , great , " Diary " soulful , and " Samsonite Man " funny and true ... this is a most have for any into soul music , such a great album , has more upbeat songs , more powerful lyrics and instant classic R&B songs .
A149OQJD0ASI07	B0000DD7LC	3	Okay , I 'm not hatin ' because Alicia really does have big-time talent . <sssss> She 's singing and playing the piano at a time in the industry when more female vocalists are spending time strippin ' and posin ' -- tryin ' 2 distract you from the fact that they do n't have skills . <sssss> Alicia , thankfully , is n't in that category . <sssss> Outside of Beyonce , she 's probably the next best female artist of the decade . <sssss> I own this CD and it 's not bad , but it 's not all that compelling or passionate once you get past her radio singles " If I Ai n't Got You " , " Karma " and the catchy , luscious " You Do n't Know My Name " . <sssss> I do believe this album is an improvement over her debut CD , but overall this album does n't tickle my fancy like a Mary J. Blige , Lauryn Hill , Faith Evans , Jill Scott , Janet Jackson or Aaliyah CD. <sssss> I 'm not saying this LP is bad ... just as an LP , it does n't hold my interest song-to-song .
AB2AQMK9PCWWX	B0000DD7LC	5	... it 's too bad that they are playing that If I Ai n't Got You w / Usher all over the place . <sssss> Not that it is n't a decent redux . <sssss> It 's just that the remix w / Kanye is just as good or if you 're so inclined , a dancible ( like R. Kelly 's Chi town steppin ' dancible ) , speaker thumping remix . <sssss> Kanye takes Keys vocals from the original ' Ai n't .... ' and speeds it up , jeep beats it up over Keys ' variation on a theme piano tricklings and her church solo vocal ad-libs and comes up with a HEY ! <sssss> rendition . <sssss> Like -- mixing the familiar with the unexpected and the moment of recognition is a HEY ! <sssss> moment . <sssss> ( Get it ? <sssss> ) You will love the extras here . <sssss> The reggae-ization of You Do n't Know My Name and vid / DVD presentations of the Keys videos . <sssss> Superb . <sssss> Get it even if you 've got the original Diary CD , it 's worth it ... ' sides , you 've worn out the first copy , anyhoo .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B0000DFZZA	5	Nelly 's Furtado 's second album Folklore ai n't no sophomore slump . <sssss> Beautiful , real , and emotionally-charged album is what you will get . <sssss> So much better then her first release , Whoa Nelly ! <sssss> All the songs on Folklore are incredible and catchy . <sssss> The song I ca n't get enough is the song Explode , " We never thought that we 'd get caught up stuck in the teenage waste as we explode ... " The Grass is Green is such an awesome track , I could listen to that song all day , I adore the line , " You opened up to me 'til I could only see the beauty in your dishonesty " . <sssss> Try is a gorgeous and rich ballad , just lovely . <sssss> Powerless and One Trick Pony will get you hooked after first listen . <sssss> Childhood Dreams is a tender song about the birth of her baby boy , " I 'm sliding down the rainbows of my childhood dreams " . <sssss> on the song Saturdays , Nelly cracks an impromtu laugh in the middle of the song , she has a cute laugh . <sssss> Folklore was defintely the best album of 2003 . <sssss> Do n't give this album a chance to slip away , it 's amazing .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B0000DFZZA	3	Nelly Furtado 's unique fusion of different musical genres made her debut album , Whoa Nelly , one of the most highly praised albums of 2000 . <sssss> While it did n't achieve as much success as it should have it still gained her a large fan base , which would be stupid if they left her now , because with the release of her sophomore album Folklore , because Furtado reaffirms our faith of why she is here . <sssss> Truth is , she is what artists like Christina Aguilera & Pink try so desperatley hard to be . <sssss> She is real and she can say whatever she wants and still have enough self-esteem to understand that its more important to stick to your morals then go out and become a greedy pig , clearly evident in the opening lines of " One Trick Pony " . <sssss> The album 's first single " Powerless " is easily her best work to date , flowing like free verse poetry showing that during her time off she has matured and was able to better focus on what she was trying to say . <sssss> The album 's fault though is that the songs are hardly memorable . <sssss> None of them were catchy enough for me to remember after the first listen and unfortunatley many of them sound the same . <sssss> But props must be given to someone who would use accordians , bongos & banjos on their album . <sssss> I 'm very intrested in seeing where her career will lead her in the future because she is a true talent and I know that she will continue to reinvent herself and mature in the future . <sssss> I get so excited listening to her albums because you ca n't help but think the best for her , its not very often someone like her comes along and she is an artist I truly cherish .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B0000DFZZA	4	Nelly Furtado scored big with the Grammy-winning album Whoa , Nelly a few years ago , but for some reason or another , she decided to be low-key with her sophomore album Folklore . <sssss> Gone are the hyped-up mainstream singles and the production by the likes of , say , Timbaland . <sssss> Also gone is the promotion , because I do n't even know what song she has out ( but the album went gold within a month , so she must be doing something right ) . <sssss> But this is still a great album . <sssss> If you 're already a fan of Ms. Furtado , then you should be satisfied with tracks like " Picture Perfect " and the funky " Powerless ( Say What You Want ) " . <sssss> The last track , " Childhood Dreams " , is also worth mentioning because of its smooth flow and also because it really shows Nelly 's vocal ability . <sssss> And " Saturdays " is also interesting in that it shows her personality , as while she provides the simple yet catchy guitar backdrop , backup vocalist Jarvis Church sings well but then jokingly drags his notes on silly lyrics ( which causes Nelly to break ) . <sssss> Though not getting as much attention as her last album , Folklore is an album that should keep listeners satisfied . <sssss> The only real misstep on here is her slight delve back into the mainstream , " Fresh Off the Boat " . <sssss> But this is still an album worth picking up . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B0000DFZZA	4	Second album of the new mother Nelly Furtado ( her child was born some two months before " Folklore " was released ) is a clear step forward from her pop / hip-hop debut , " Whoa Nelly " . <sssss> The sophomore effort may lack the playfulness and girlish charm that was there first time around , but is more mature . <sssss> That she 's on the move is evident from sounds and textures she employed . <sssss> Among guest stars there is , among others , a banjo legend Bela Fleck . <sssss> Opening " One-Trick Pony " and " Powerless " ( the first single , starting roughly there where " Whoa Nelly " left off ) kick off the album well , coming closest to real ' folklore ' on Brazil-infused " Fresh Off The Boat " and " Forca " . <sssss> Slower highlights are the melodic " The Grass Is Green " , soaring " Island of Wonder " and " Childhood Dreams " , an epic organ-tinged seven-minute closer which almost seems out of place , but may be a hint of what 's to come . <sssss> Let 's hope Nelly Furtado has more surprises in store for us .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B0000DFZZA	3	Folklore being Furtado 's 2nd album suffers from her taking herself a little bit too seriously and the lyrics are suffering because of this . <sssss> The melodies are amazing but the lyrics seem heavy handed at times as if she is adding a level of seriousness that at times feels forced . <sssss> The reviews were generally negative when this album came out and Allmusic , Rolling Stone , Spinn and Blender all gave the album 2/5 or 3/5 . <sssss> I think 2/5 is a bit low but 3/5 is more then generous since the lyrics really drag down this album . <sssss> The booklet is a mixed bag with Ms Furtado dressed is some truly atrocious outfits and the font for the lyrics is too small . <sssss> All the lyrics are included and we get a list of whom plays what on each track . <sssss> 3/5 .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B0000DFZZA	4	Now you knew Nelly Furtado was gone hit us off with something off the wall her second time around . <sssss> After the satisfaction that her debut gave the listener it was only right to expect potential greatness on the second album . <sssss> Everybody knows that Nelly Furtado can sing ... that 's a given ... and you knew her style was off the chain and different . <sssss> You knew her songwriting was gon na be good to great . <sssss> The question was " Could she bring it all together on one amazing album " ? <sssss> The answer to that question is yes and no . <sssss> Some songs are just flat out excellent ; Try , Saturdays , One Trick Pony , Powerless , Picture Perfect . <sssss> The Grass is Green is also a nice tune as well as Childhood Dreams . <sssss> But the real winner here is Build You Up . <sssss> Beautiful song right there about ego and fame . <sssss> But Island of Wonder , Forca , and Fresh Off The Boat could have been left off in my opinion . <sssss> Nelly Furtado delivers for the most part on this album and if you like your music eclectic , moving , refreshing , and tantalizing , go ahead and give this album a try .
A3I675GA2O8I59	B0000DFZZA	5	The Canadian artist , NELLY FURTADO manages to prove to her fans and critics that she 's much more than a one hit wonder about to fly away . <sssss> Her nominations at the 2002 GRAMMY AWARDS were well deserved as she is truly a serious artist deserving our attention . <sssss> On this release , FURTADO reveals an edgier artistic side yet she maintains her infectious musical hooks in her melodies . <sssss> Songs such as the first single POWERLESS and BUILD YOU UP are catchy tracks that stick firmly in your head . <sssss> Other tracks such as PICTURE PERFECT sound like SHERYL CROW crossbred with a JIMMY HENDRIX ballad-vibe . <sssss> This CD is really one of the best Pop releases of the year . <sssss> Once again FURTADO should be found on the podiums come the 2004 music award season .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B0000DFZZA	5	After the huge success with " Whoa Nelly " she 's back with her second album , which is just as good , if not better . <sssss> A very original artist with a unique sound . <sssss> She merges alot of diffrent genres into one unique genre , lots of songs are influents from her Portuguese roots but there 's lot more to explore here , like all those unordinary instruments they used . <sssss> Critics said her first album was non-commercial but this is even less commercial . <sssss> A personal and beautiful album even if we have n't heard so much about the songs on radio this time . <sssss> " Powerless " is a meliodic song about prejudices , " Try " is slow and beautiful , it has simular samples like a techno song from a few years ago , i like this alot . <sssss> " Explore " is also fun , Nelly singing fast with a diffrent sound ( like usual ) . <sssss> " Forca " is portuguese , showes some of her influents . <sssss> Caetano Veloso helps out on " Islands of wonder " . <sssss> " Picture perfect " is great too , nice guitar riffs and sensual somehow . <sssss> Lstly credit to " One-trcik pony " , one of a few radio friendly songs , pleasant song with good hook . <sssss> There are 12 songs on the album , which is a good number , most songs are quite long though . <sssss> This album was made in a artistic way , the songs make sense and sound unique and are good . <sssss> This will be remembered a long time forward . <sssss> Eternal music .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B0000DFZZA	5	Nelly Furtado proves with ' Folklore ' that she was far from a one-album hype ! <sssss> Her songwriting an singing skills in songs such as the closing ( touching ) track , " Childhood Dreams " , the single " Powerless ( Say What You Want ) " or the beautiful " Island of Wonder " ( where Brazilian legend Caetano Veloso accompanies her ) are outstanding , beyond any other pop and most hip-hop acts right now . <sssss> And that is quite ironic , because though she 's labeled as a pop / hip-hop artist , her music defies being put in a bin and have a label attached to it. <sssss> A blend of native rhythms and spirit , sprinkled with happy hip-hop influences and a touch of genius in her multilingual lyrics ( " Forca " , for instance , goes back and forth between English to Portuguese almost seamlessly ) bring us in ' Folklore ' an album that is ripe for the times , as the times are ready for it , an international album that goes beyond borders and races , that touches on the folk heart we all carry regardless of where we come from . <sssss> However you look at it with this work , Nelly proves she came to stay for a long time , and I can only smile at the thought of her future productions , considering how solid her work already is at age 23 !
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B0000DFZZA	4	I was a little aprehensive about buying this CD , especially after debut . <sssss> Remove " Like A Bird " and " Turn Off The Light " , and you have a train wreck . <sssss> Gladly , this album shows how much she has matured and is a pleasure to listen to ! <sssss> The biggest difference in this disc is how much she has matured , how consistent the overall album is and how nicely she pegs the genre she was aiming at . <sssss> I enjoyed listening to this album , even on the third spin the day I bought it . <sssss> Granted , there are no complete stand-outs like " Like A Bird " or " Turn Out The Lights " , but you do n't have to have Top 40 hits to deliver a quality recording . <sssss> I really liked One-Trick Pony , Powerless , Fresh Off The Boat ( in a weird way . <sssss> hehe ) , Picture Perfect ( my favorite ) and Childhood Dreams . <sssss> If you like her first album , you 're sure to love this one !
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B0000DFZZA	4	I do n't know wassup ? <sssss> , this is a great album , I do n't get it ? <sssss> , why radio did n't played " Powerless " , is such an infectuos song , with strong lyrics and great music arregments , and strong message of self-power . <sssss> So I wo n't say this was a great deep album without any strong easy to like singles , because as " Powerless " , " Try " are strong POP song that could easily make the transition to radio waves , but then " Try " was also neglected the airplay , I do n't get it , Nelly 's best vocals , a dramatic ballad about , comformism in love and a message to do n't give up on love , great track , in fact the best of the album , to the people who have n't heard this album , this record explore more exotic rhythm , specially those close to Nelly 's background of portuguese heritage . <sssss> " One Trcik Pony " is great opener , a upbeat song , with the classic nasal voice of Nelly stomping the rhythm , " Explode " is not a great for to be the third single , but is announce as it , but is a moving-fast-driven track with genuos use of Nelly vocals , " Fresh Of The Boat " is afunky number , " Forca " is deep and moving , " The Grass Is Green " has a strong feelin ' and great message , " Picture Perfect " is average , " Saturdays " sounds gospel , " Build You Up " is lyrical driven , " Island Of Wonder " the most folkloric of all , " Childhood Dreams " reminds you of Kate Bush , a very deep lyrical track , one of the most intimate , in fact this recod is really good , and more mature than the previous as obviously Nelly Furtado has grown , so sad , that the media has not given the welcome that Nelly deserve , this is a underrated album , and you should give it a listen cos all Nelly can do is " Try " ... buy it .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B00016XMOE	5	I have enjoyed all of Alanis 's albums , and like most people , Jagged Little Pill was my favorite of hers . <sssss> I used to wonder if she would ever make another album like that , but after hearing " Everything " , I was shocked to not hear the anger I loved so much from JLP . <sssss> Then I realized that Alanis has matured as an artist and can sing whatever she wants . <sssss> She will never make another album like JLP , but if she makes more albums like this one , then Alanis will be in great shape . <sssss> This is one of the best CDs I 've heard all year . <sssss> Alanis has called this her " calm and soothing " CD . <sssss> While she does n't go all Enya on us , she does offer music that rather than critique others , critiques herself . <sssss> " Doth I Protest Too Much " and " This Grudge " are particularly eye-opening because they show Alanis letting go of the rage that has fueled many of her best songs . <sssss> A risky move , but one that pays off for the listener . <sssss> Although many people will grouse that this album is n't the same as JLP , I love the fact that Alanis has not only grown as an artist , but has also realized that her true fans will continue with her in this new and equally exciting direction .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B00016XMOE	5	Alanis Morissette 's So-Called Chaos is a glorious and fun record . <sssss> I love all her albums , Under Rug Swept is her best , but for my favorite , it is defintely this album . <sssss> Only ten songs here , but they are big , mighty songs with intelligent lyrics and rock out music . <sssss> Eight Easy Steps is pure genius : " How to stay stuck in blue by blaming them for everything ... " Out is Through is very mellow and simple : " We could just walkaway and hide our heads in the sand ... " Excuses is the song i feel the most closest to : " These excuses , how they have served me so well , they 've kept me safe , they 've kept me stuck ... " My fave song is Doth I protest too much : " I 'm not enraged , not insecure as such ... " Bees of my Knees is catchy and cute : " You make the bees of my knees weak , tremble and buckle " . <sssss> The title track has the best guitar music ever ! <sssss> " I wan na be naked runnning through the streets , i wan na invite this so-called chaos ... " Not all Me is very grown-up Alanis : " It 's not all me , it 's not all my fault ... " This Grudge is classic Alanis : " I wan na be big and let go ... " Spineless is the best song on the record " I know you 'd leave if I rocked the boat " . <sssss> Everything is accepting yourself and the person who loves you uncondtionally : " You see everything , you see all my light and you love my dark " . <sssss> This album is so damn good ! <sssss> Do n't waste to purchase this album , you wo n't be disappointed .
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP	B00016XMOE	5	This is Alanis Morissette 's fourth studio album , just as good as its predecessor , UNDER RUG SWEPT . <sssss> I still think JAGGED LITTLE PILL , her 1995 debut is the best . <sssss> In fact , that was one of 1996 's best-sellers . <sssss> This short and sweet album is only 42 minutes in length which is uncommon today . <sssss> Many pre-1989 albums played in entirety were in that length of time or near . <sssss> EIGHT EASY STEPS , EVERYTHING , the title track and I DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH are cool . <sssss> The other songs are very good . <sssss> Alanis is now a mature 30-year-old woman whose style is n't much anymore like it was nine years ago .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00016XMOE	4	I remember seeing the video for " Everything " on VH1 and I asked , " This is Alanis Morissette " ? <sssss> Not that it 's a bad song , but I was surprised not to hear any yelling ( for lack of a better term ) . <sssss> And there really is n't any loud singing on the album , except maybe on the song she has out now , " Eight Easy Steps " . <sssss> Apparently a lot of reviewers feel the same way I did , saying that the old Alanis was more entertaining than the new Alanis . <sssss> Yes , if you have all of her other albums and enjoy them , you may not feel the same -- at least , at first listen -- about So-Called Chaos . <sssss> This album was written in the midst of her relationship with her now fianc&eacute; , Ryan Reynolds ( best known from playing the title role of National Lampoon 's Van Wilder ; or did n't anyone else see that movie either ? <sssss> ) . <sssss> That probably explains why many of the songs on here are romantic . <sssss> But these songs are n't sappy or anything . <sssss> There are lovely songs like " Out Is Through " and the aforementioned " Everything " . <sssss> And when Alanis gets innovative with the subject matter , it 's still impressive , as evidenced by " This Grudge " ( some think it 's a response to " You Oughta Know " ) and " Not All Me " . <sssss> With a slim ten tracks totaling just over 40 minutes , So-Called Chaos is an album that 's just right for a quick listen . <sssss> The only real flaw is that I have no idea what she 's talking about on " Knees of My Bees " . <sssss> But love Alanis ' new style or hate it , you should still add this to your collection . <sssss> Who knows , you might like it after a while . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
AW7CV7F94ULDU	B00016XMOE	4	This betters " Under Rug Swept " and has more radio friendly quality to it , I randomly bought this thinking what the hell but this is not " JLP " but this just may be one of her best albums since " JLP " I Really love The Opening Track " Eight Easy Steps " and then it goes on to " Out is through " and nearly track after track is listenable , " This Grudge " for me is the highlight of the album itself its a wonderful track and 2 songs after " grudge " , " Everything " kicks in , another great song . <sssss> This album deserves a # 1 spot more than " Under Rug Swept " which was just average , instead this album can be reffered to as a Top 5 AlbumKey TraX : Eight Easy StepsOut Is ThroughExcusesKnees Of My BeesThis GrudgeSpinelessEverythingI Reccomend " S-CC " at about 89 % or 92 % very good album
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B00016XMOE	5	Alanis has a winner on her hands with SO CALLED CHAOS . <sssss> The music sounds fresh and different from her other albums , but it still maintains the same honesty that her lyrics have always had . <sssss> The first single is " Everything " , a different sounding song for Alanis , not a favorite but it 's ok . <sssss> " Eight Easy Steps " is a great rocking song with a killer chorus . <sssss> " Excuses " is my favorite on the album , it sounds a bit like " Precious Illusions " . <sssss> Other highlights on the disc include the title track , " Spineless " , and " Out Is Through " .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B00016XMOE	5	While nothing has really compared to JAGGED LITTLE PILL ( save for some of the songs on the UNPLUGGED collection ... ) , this album comes awfully close to the high standard set by that album . <sssss> All of the songs are really good ... and Alanis sounds so happy ! <sssss> I think this album reflects her continued growth as an artist and a person . <sssss> It is so easy to compare each album to the first major breakthrough disc , but I do n't think this will work with Alanis . <sssss> For her , each CD itself must be evaluated for what is great ... . <sssss> and there are many great songs here . <sssss> EVERYTHING is a highlight ... along with EIGHT EASY STEPS , KNEES OF MY BEES , and THIS GRUDGE . <sssss> So , if you are looking for something fresh and new in the rock / pop arena , Alanis surely delivers ... and you certainly wo n't be disappointed in the results shown in this disc . <sssss> Go out and get this one today !
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B00016XMOE	5	SO CALLED CHAOS is the follow up to Alanis Morissette 's 2002 album UNDER RUG SWEPT . <sssss> In late 2002 she also released a b-sides / dvd set called FEAST ON SCRAPS . <sssss> This is an excellent album that does not disapoint at all . <sssss> The first single is " Everything " , it 's a nice pop song , would n't be my first choice for single but it seems to be doing well . <sssss> I 've heard the next single is the opening track " Eight Easy Steps " , which should be a huge hit with its great melody and catchy chorus . <sssss> Honestly I do n't think you can compare her albums , because she seems to be different on each of them . <sssss> On this one , she seems to be finding peace and enjoying being in love , letting go of the past , and all of that . <sssss> She 's matured . <sssss> " This Grudge " is a favorite of mine , it 's a nice revealing ballad . <sssss> The title track would be a good single , so would " Excuses " . <sssss> Other highlights for me include " Knees of My Bees " and " Out Is Through " . <sssss> Overall a nice short album , but good from start to finish .
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B00016XMOE	4	Once again Alanis is reliable as a counselor and psychotherapist . <sssss> " So-Called Chaos " might sound more streamlined than " Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie " , but this is what Morissette needed . <sssss> Unlike her previous three albums , this one is most likely her most consistent work . <sssss> Of the ten tracks there is n't one standout dud like there are on her previous three works . <sssss> In fact , you could add " Eight Easy Steps " , " Out Is Through " , " Excuses " and " Everything " her growing canon of hits and insightful advice on how to , and how not to , behave in relationships . <sssss> She is dead on in her advice , and I sometimes wish more people would listen to Alanis because she is one of the most honest songwriters we have these days . <sssss> I do n't think she 's sold-out with this one , I believe she 's succeeded " Jagged Little Pill " . <sssss> You see , the problem seems to be that people want her to be angry , but anyone can tell you that you mature and grow out of the anger and hopefully into a more centered and balance person . <sssss> I 've seen those who have let anger eat them alive and have not been able to move forward with their lives . <sssss> Alanis proves with " So-Called Chaos " that she is definitely putting both feet forward and reflecting on her past mistakes and learning to forgive herself for her and forgive others for theirs . <sssss> Easily one of the better releases of 2004 .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B00016XMOE	5	This is a nice album from Alanis Morissette . <sssss> Through each album , I think we see her going through changes . <sssss> On this one , she seems to be accepting the past and embracing love . <sssss> Her sound has also evolved , as she experiments with a more contemporary pop sound , that still encorporates her lyrics and her own style . <sssss> As well , she finally cut her hair and looks great . <sssss> The first single is the midtempo ballad " Everything " . <sssss> Not a favorite , but it 's nice . <sssss> The next single is the wonderful opening " Eight Easy Steps " , a nice short song that has a great chorus that grabs you . <sssss> There 's some fine moments on here , like the confessional " This Grudge " , or the honest " Out Is Through " . <sssss> I also really like the title track and " Excuses " . <sssss> " Knees of My Bees " , " Spineless " and " Doth I Protest Too Much " are great songs as well . <sssss> Overall a strong album , short but sweet .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00016XMOE	2	it was n't that long ago that Alanis Morissette ditched the Paula Abdul early Musical offerings that she first came out with . <sssss> but she has been Mellowing & Mellowing more over time & while that is cool in spots something about Her Musical presentation over the years keeps falling off . <sssss> she seems at a Crossroads as a Artist & ca n't get out of the Rut she is on . <sssss> she still gives you a Moment or two here & there but truth be told unless She truly changes Her Stylings up a bit then her albums will continue to go down as Boring .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B00016XMOE	3	As a huge Alanis fan , I was really looking forward to the release of her new album . <sssss> Now that I have it , and have listened to it a number of time , I ca n't help but feel somewhat of a letdown , certainly after the brilliant " Under Rug Swept " album , which in my book remains the best album Alanis has made to date . <sssss> " So-Called Chaos " ( 10 tracks , 41 min . <sssss> ) starts off with another recipe to men for living the Alanis way : " Eight Easy Ways " invites comparisons to " 21 Things I Want in a Lover " from the previous album . <sssss> " Out Is Through " is also quite good . <sssss> After that , however , the album starts to lag . <sssss> The use of sitar on " Knees of My Bees " sounds out of place ( and what is with the song 's title ? <sssss> ) . <sssss> The title track , the best on the album , gives a much-needed boost of energy , only to then drop off again on " Not All Me " and " This Grudge " . <sssss> The closing track " Everything " ( and very curious choice for first single ) is reflective of the album : promising but not enough catchy hooks . <sssss> I do give Alanis credit for keeping the album at 41 min . <sssss> ( similar to the " Under Rug Swept " album ) . <sssss> Many artists nowadays feel obligated to fill the CD with 70 + min . <sssss> of music , even if they have not nearly enough quality material .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00016XMOE	4	This album is extraordinary ! <sssss> , it 's not the best of Morissette , but it 's so cared free , so I do n't care ! <sssss> , that it 's fuses all the sense of POP-ROCK MUSIC represented . <sssss> The title track SO CALLED CHAOS it 's my personal fav . <sssss> How anyone can explain how good it 's sounds when she said . <sssss> this so called chaos ... on the chorus line , so delightful , KNEES OF BEES ? <sssss> , that 's the title , well , this track it 's a rocker , an easy to go with beat , simple love song ! <sssss> , EXCUSES it 's an Morissette-esque track , OUT IS TROUGH it 's a more deeper joint , and the leading single EVERYTHING it 's an undeniable introspective song with an amazing final ending shouting sing by miss Alanis , many condem her by not keeping up with the angry not easy to deal Alanis , but I think Alanis explore a more open happy side as she has grown to be , this is a more than expected welcome to Alanis . <sssss> Although it points to be a commercial dissapointment , true Alanis fans will find to understand the direction Miss Ironic has taken , well done Alanis .
A20OAPE0RCEJ9P	B00018D44U	5	It 's only natural for an artist to experience backlash , especially when they have an album that swept the Grammies and sold millions of copies all over the world . <sssss> In Norah Jones 's case , however , does the backlash really matter ? <sssss> Sure , some people may complain about her and say that she is n't " real music " , but really , does any of that matter ? <sssss> Norah is a class act and people can say all the negative things about her they want , but just take a look at this album 's ranking on the Amazon sales charts and you will see that this backlash against her means absolutely nothing . <sssss> This album has already sold millions of copies and you can bet it will continue to do well , especially at Grammy time .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B00018D44U	5	Norah Jones : International mega star with 25 million albums sold worldwide and sold-out tours around the globe , and she 's done it all without once taking her top off for the guys ! <sssss> Now that 's impressive ;) Norah , once again , seemlessly blends blues , jazz , folk pop and bluegrass into her gorgeous tunes . <sssss> The original edition of FEELS LIKE HOME is fab , and the 3 bonus tracks ( ' Moon Song ' and ' Sleepless Nights ' are both available as b-sides on international singles ) are sweet , delicate ear candy . <sssss> The videos on the DVD are lovely and well constructed ( nothing over the top ) , but the music is really why I 'm a Norah Jones fans . <sssss> Truth be told , Norah was actually opposed to her album being re-packaged ( she finds ' deluxe ' editions too commercial and insists her record label is soley responsible for FEELS LIKE HOME being re-released ) . <sssss> That 's one of the reasons I absolutely love Norah : She 's about the music , not the numbers . <sssss> If you do n't have FEELS LIKE HOME yet , then buy this version . <sssss> If you already own the regular edition , then a legal downloading service might be able to help you add the bonus tracks to your collection .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B00018D44U	3	To say that Norah Jone 's debut album ' Come Away With Me ' was a breath of fresh air is an understatement . <sssss> The bluesy-jazz influenced debut was a masterpiece , with critics and fans both appreciating the flawless material . <sssss> Her deep , breathy & sultry voice is very sexy , even when she is n't singing about love or relationships . <sssss> While there is nothing on ' Feels like Home ' that can hold a candle to her incomprable debut set , its still more than likely to be one of the better releases in the near future . <sssss> Norah 's voice is such an astounding instrument , that the need of background music is very minimal , which she knows by the fact her material is never overproduced . <sssss> But on the other hand , there is nothing here that sticks with you like the first time around . <sssss> The only real standouts include " Sunrise " , " What Am I To You " & " Be Here to Love Me " . <sssss> I recommend getting her first record rather than purchasing this one . <sssss> I knew that this record was n't going to be better than the first , but I was expecting it to be better than it was .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B00018D44U	4	I pointed out in one of my guides last year that I was wondering where Norah Jones went , because she was quiet pretty much all the way through 2003 . <sssss> Well , my question was answered as soon as I saw the video for " Sunrise " in late January on VH1 . <sssss> I had been waiting for Norah to come back , and she did that and then some with her sophomore album Feels Like Home . <sssss> If there are any songs that are better than the rest , they would have to be -- well , actually , it 's hard to say any one song on here is better than another , but I 'm gon na have to go with " What Am I to You " , " Those Sweet Words " , and the spiritual " Humble Me " . <sssss> And as usual , there are a few remakes on here , like Townes Van Zandt 's " Be Here to Love Me " , as well as " The Long Way Home " ; the latter was originally done a few years ago by Tom Waits on the Big Bad Love soundtrack ( although I never heard of that movie or any of the other artists featured on that soundtrack , either , but maybe that 's just me ) . <sssss> Another interesting thing about this album is that Norah is now expanding her vocal abilities . <sssss> She does n't try to hit any really high notes or anything , but you 'll understand what I mean when you listen to songs like " Toes " and the aforementioned " What Am I to You " . <sssss> I gave this album four stars for one reason and one reason only : it is very hard to measure up to Come Away With Me . <sssss> But that aspect does n't take away any of the greatness of this album . <sssss> Feels Like Home is right at home in my collection . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B00018D44U	4	" Feels Like Home " , the follow-up to widely ( and wildly ) celebrated debut " Come Away With Me " is not as easy listening album as its predecessor , which however does not mean that it 's not as good . <sssss> It may be even better , but its charms do not unfold so easily . <sssss> Also , " Home " lacks the joy and elegance of some blues and pop tunes which were there the first time around ; especially notable is the absence of songwriter Jesse Harris , who penned such gems as " Shoot the Moon " and " Do n't Know Why " . <sssss> The tones are mostly country , sometimes even alt-country , the mood is relaxed , thoughtful , even impressionistic , with the best cut saved for last , achingly beautiful " Do n't Miss You At All " , written by the great Sir Duke . <sssss> " Feels Like Home " is certainly an album difficult to get tired of , but its risk mainly lies in that some listeners may not get the patience they need until it finally grows on them . <sssss> Most " Come Away With Me " lovers should enjoy " Feels Like Home " but those seeking instant gratification may fail easily .
A1NVEW628JUS2Y	B00018D44U	3	I recently lost my tranquilizer pills to keep me calm , but as it turns out , this Norah Jones CD is the perfect fixx !! <sssss> She has a tried-n-true voice that really keeps me on balance . <sssss> I saw her perform on Saturday Night Live , and the results were stunning . <sssss> I ca n't believe she 's not more popular . <sssss> If you 're looking for relaxation , this is the one ! <sssss> Have a peaceful night !!!!!!!!!!!! 
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD	B00018D44U	4	Norah Jones - Feels Like Home ( Blue Note , 2004 ) If you loved Come Away With Me , then you 'll love this album too because it 's practically the same album , just not without a noticeable hit like " Do n't Know Why " . <sssss> Similar to India . <sssss> Arie 's sophomore album , do n't expect a significant growth in Jones 's songwriting and performance because it 's only been a short time between this album and her last . <sssss> This album still has highlights aplenty like " What Am I To You " ? <sssss> and the Dolly Parton duet , " Creepin ' In " . <sssss> Norah Jones has bypassed the sophomore jinx with this one . <sssss> - EJR
A3I675GA2O8I59	B00018D44U	5	In reviewing the comments placed on Amazon , one can not help but notice that some music fans are becoming jaded with the recent trend to infuse Pop and Jazz . <sssss> In 2003 , Norah overtook the Grammys with her previous release . <sssss> As a result of her commercial appeal and critical success , many major labels signed artists that would reflect and follow in JONES ' musical footsteps . <sssss> FEEL LIKE HOME is a CD as musically perfect as her last release . <sssss> One can not deny that JONES knows how to tenderly deliver a lyric . <sssss> From the first chorus in SUNRISE , one can notice how her vocals remain both smoky and sweet . <sssss> If you enjoyed the last release , do not hesitate to purchase this cd . <sssss> It is up to you to decide but I seriously doubt that you 'll regret the purchase .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B00018D44U	4	I was a bit apprehensive with purchasing this one . <sssss> I got COME AWAY WITH ME after hearing DO N'T KNOW WHY and was a little disappointed . <sssss> But I am glad I did n't listen to my mind ... and went with what my sould was saying . <sssss> This album is surprisingly good ... . <sssss> and a little more upbeat than the previous . <sssss> It is quite obvious that the country influence has definitely come into the Norah 's music . <sssss> The best songs on here are SUNRISE ... and the absolutely awesome CREEPIN ' IN . <sssss> Norah and Dolly Parton sound really great together ... . <sssss> and I really hope this is the next single , because I really think it has a chance to become a big hit . <sssss> It is a jazzy mingling of bluegrass that is sure to get your heart beating and your toes tapping ! <sssss> The rest of the album complements these two tracks , and I think it is worth a listen whether you do it at a listening booth or actually buy the CD and take it home . <sssss> You will be pleasantly surprised ... . <sssss> and the songs just wo n't get out of your head !
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B00018D44U	5	After the big impact of her CD " Come away with me " that won 8 Grammys and had been certified Platinum x8 and it 's still on the Top 50 on the Hot 200 from Billboard after 2 years of its release . <sssss> Norah Jones comes back with this delightful CD with the same style of the first but well I might add that it contains a smooth touch of Country style but sounds very good . <sssss> The lyrics are fantastic along with the instruments and Norah 's voice that really makes you relax and feel pleased . <sssss> Personally I listen to her music at home while I 'm reading or sending mails and sometimes when I 'm driving and it really relaxes me . <sssss> You can also find a duet with Dolly Parton on this production . <sssss> If you like this production , I 'm more than sure that you 'll love " Come away with me " ( I prefer that one ) .
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B00018D44U	3	If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , then what 's to say when you carbon copy yourself ? <sssss> When your voice is as astonishingly clear and silky as Jones 's , you say congratulations . <sssss> Do n't fix what ai n't broke ... and ' Feels Like Home ' is a comforting , familiar sophomore effort by a young artist still honing her indelible craft while not pandering to a new audience or defiling her core fan base . <sssss> Arif Mardin produces again [ actually , co-producing w/Norah ] , Jesse Harris back strumming his acoustic guitar on a few tracks , her Handsome Band backing up quietly and seductively , Dolly Parton and Levon Helm lending support , covering Tom Waits splendidly , and with her ravishing voice and heavenly Yamaha , establishing herself as never-really-a-jazz-singer , but a supreme force of nature . <sssss> My grade : B +
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B00018D44U	3	Come Away With Me was nice , mostly because other people wrote Norah songs for her . <sssss> But on this cd , the songwriting is not up to the same quality ( she and her boyfriend are doing most of the writing ) . <sssss> Plus , I was expecting her to show more muscle vocally ( to prove her doubters that she can sing ) and she totally did n't . <sssss> The only difference between this cd and her last one is on this cd ; she has become less of a jazz singer and more country . <sssss> I am disappointed in this cd , but I ca n't blast this cd . <sssss> It still ranks high and above a lot of crap that 's on the radio today . <sssss> I just hope that Norah realizes that she has to show more growth and connect with her emotions if she wants to continue as an artist like this . <sssss> She is a very nice person , humble and down to earth . <sssss> But she lost me on this one .
A1IANEBSMVGHS9	B00018D44U	2	Norah Jones ' latest effort was dissapointing to say the least . <sssss> I felt there was potential to her when I listened to her first album , but after listening to this album certainly I am not " feeling the same way " . <sssss> The first few songs stand out , but in general the album is ( yes , you 've heard it before ) booooring and repetitive . <sssss> It 's hard to put your finger on almost any song after the fifth track because they all sound very similar and , in a way , dull . <sssss> " The Prettiest Thing " and the closing Ellington song " Do n't Miss You At All " are the only other songs that stand out in the second half of the album : the rest I can totally live without . <sssss> Granted I loved the use of electric piano on some of the tracks , giving them a bit of an edge , overall I do n't see this as more than a two-star album . <sssss> I recommend Jacqui Naylor 's ' Shelter ' - far better !
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B00018D44U	2	Norah Jones has Talent but this Project feels like the Label Heads said lets cash in & she also is having the Job of trying to top Herself out from how large Her Debut was . <sssss> she has to have room to Grow & this set more or less is a formula Follow-Up as to Being something different . <sssss> cool idea with working with Dolly Parton . <sssss> but like Much Alicia Key 's follow up it seems like striking on the Same Shirt & just using the same iron & Board on the Same spot .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B00018D44U	2	Wow . <sssss> What can say ? <sssss> I can safely say Nora wo n't have to worry about carting home eight Grammys next year . <sssss> She wo n't have to worry about carting away one . <sssss> This is one of the biggest sophomore flops I can remember and my expectations were not even that high . <sssss> There are so many things wrong with this CD : 1 ) The sound transfer to the CD is awful . <sssss> I played this at a low volume and her voice was still distorted in three of the songs . <sssss> 2 ) The material , melodies and album continuity is absolutely dismal . <sssss> I only liked one song on the disc , In The Morning , which is why I even gave it two stars . <sssss> These are not quality written songs . <sssss> 3 ) She did a duet with Dolly Parton on Creepin ' In and Dolly was n't listed as a co-singer . <sssss> She was only listed in the " appears as a courtesy " section . <sssss> Such disrespect for an icon . <sssss> 4 ) The record company released the liner notes with unfinished paper . <sssss> Yep , not even a gloss finish . <sssss> It 's no surprise because it matches the rest of the album - CHEAP . <sssss> Friends and fellow music lovers , if you think this is going to be even remotely like her debut album , you are wrong . <sssss> This is unprofessional piano lounge music . <sssss> I think Capitol Records owes the music community an explanation . <sssss> This reeks of corporate greed and does nothing to raise musical interests .
A38UBVJEV1LLS7	B00018D44U	5	" Come Away With Me " was a wonderful album , although not worthy of all the Grammys it picked up , but enjoyable . <sssss> However , with this album Norah was shed her old skin for a much more " folksy " sound that is music to my ears ( but I get the feeling that others do not agree based on its rating ) . <sssss> " Sunrise " is a more upbeat , but still soft , follow-up to " Come Away With Me " , and may , in fact , be better . <sssss> I will say , though , that the duet with Dolly " Creepin ' In " , may have been a little over the top . <sssss> All in all , a step in the right direction .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B00018D44U	5	Norah Jones sophomore effort is a continuation of its predecessor . <sssss> A loose blend of jazz , folk and country , coupled with her clear , almost breathy vocals . <sssss> Right from the beautiful surreal cover art , you know you 're in for a treat . <sssss> ` Sunrise ' , the lead off single , opens the cd to good effect . <sssss> It 's a light , breezy song . <sssss> ` Carnival town ' is an excellent cabaret style number , one of 6 songs penned or co penned by Jones . <sssss> ` In the morning ' is another beauty , with some great bass playing . <sssss> ` Humble me ' is a beautiful song of contrition and forgiveness , almost Gospel like . <sssss> ` Above ground ' , The long way home ' ( with delightful guitar strumming ) , The prettiest thing ' ( very pretty song ) , and ` Do n't miss you at all ' ( a tender piano ballad which samples Duke Ellington to good effect ) , are other standouts from this stark , understated gem . <sssss> This cd will do your collection no harm .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B00018D44U	4	Norah Jones has the unenviable task of following up a smash debut album , Come Away With Me , that hit number one ( and still is in the top twenty-five after almost two years on the charts ) , sold eight million copies and won the big three at the Grammys , Record , Album & Song of the year . <sssss> With her new release , Feels Like Home , Ms. Jones does n't stray too far from the formula of her first album . <sssss> Feels Like Home also mixes jazz , country , folk and blues , but Ms. Jones sounds more confident and mature . <sssss> The song that really shows this off is " What Am I To You " ? <sssss> , which is her only solo composition on the album . <sssss> The song has a riff that grabs you right away and Ms. Jones applies a breathy vocal that rises as she reaches the chorus . <sssss> She dives into 70 's singer-songwriter terrain on " Toes " & " Carnival Town " that recall another woman with the same last name , Rickie Lee Jones . <sssss> Ms. Jones gets Dolly Parton to provide guest vocals on " Creepin ' In " which gets into bluegrass territory . <sssss> The album closes out with " Do n't Miss You At All " which is Duke Ellington 's " Melancholia " that Ms. Jones added lyrics . <sssss> Feels Like Home will probably not match the commercial success of its predecessor , but it shows that Ms. Jones is growing as a truly distictive artist who feels at home in various and distinct musical styles .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B00018D44U	5	Feels like Home is a very good album . <sssss> Norah Jones sounds great on all these tracks . <sssss> I liked every song on this CD . <sssss> Sunrise is a very pretty song about how quickly time flies by . <sssss> It is a romantic song with simple lyrics . <sssss> Toes is a great song about how the simple act of toes touching water can make a person feel safe and at ease . <sssss> These two songs are examples of how Norah sings about the beauty of ordinary things so well . <sssss> I enjoyed the sassy blues song What Am I to You ? <sssss> It is a good song about being devoted to the person you love , but also about wondering if that person loves you in return . <sssss> I loved the song Carnival Town . <sssss> It is very relaxed and soothing . <sssss> Norah sounds great on the piano on this track too . <sssss> Humble Me is another favorite song on this album . <sssss> It is about being alone and down on your luck and asking forgiveness for your miskakes . <sssss> Creepin in is a lively country duet with Dolly Parton . <sssss> Their voices blend very well together . <sssss> I think it 's great that Norah continues to explore with different styles of music . <sssss> The Long Way Home is an excellent song about struggling to keep things together and trying to find a place called home . <sssss> I wish the words to this song were included here . <sssss> I loved the smooth silky romantic quality of the song Do n't Miss You at All . <sssss> Norah Jones combines elements of jazz , blues , country , and pop music on this album to create her own unique sound . <sssss> It is an excellent follow up to her debut Come Away With Me . <sssss> I loved listening to Feels like Home .
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	B00018D44U	5	" Feels Like Home " the second delivery by Miss Jones is not a stranger to any who bought her jazzy debut album , she kept the escence of the first and made a new one with more innovative lyrics that do n't dissapoint the listener . <sssss> She works again with hit-maker producer Arif Mardin , and has some special guest like the country-legend Dolly Parton . <sssss> Not that Jones it 's known by her singles on the radio , but , her first cut to be release and promote " Sunrise " is delightful and lite , with the same chillout feeling that enchanted us the first time with " Do n't Know Why " , in conclution all the tracks will give you time to think , listen to the music , sleep , drink coffee , or simply study , it 's a very versatile record , so all the tracks are easy to handle and in the same formula , the lyrics change , and some sound more country than jazz , but if I have to mention some stand out cuts will be : " Sunrise " , " The Long Way Home " , " Creepin ' In " . <sssss> , " Do n't Miss You at All " , , overall this is a great record that could take your stress away .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B000197KVW	3	After reading all the negative reviews for George Michael 's latest album Patience , I have a question : is this album really bad or is it just bad compared to Faith ? <sssss> Although it 's true that Faith was his best album ( and thus may make all his other albums pale in comparison ) , that does n't mean THIS album is dismissible . <sssss> There are several good songs to find on here , like " Amazing " and the mellow title track . <sssss> And as usual , there is a nice variety of introspective tracks , like the feel-sorry-for-yourself ( and maybe suicidal ) " I 'm Through " . <sssss> There 's also the political " Shoot the Dog " , which was actually removed from the album at the last minute due to its controversy , so it looks like you 'll have to download it if you want to hear it. <sssss> I just could n't get into some of the other songs , though , especially " John & Elvis Are Dead " . <sssss> And " Please Send Me Someone " is a nice tribute to George 's first boyfriend ( who died from AIDS ) , but maybe the song would have been better if it was n't so uptempo . <sssss> Also , " Freeek ! ` 04 " might be a little too crazy for his own good . <sssss> Everything else is pretty listenable except for the fact that you might find a generic lyric here and there . <sssss> Patience may not be George 's best album , but it 's living proof that he 's still talented and he wo n't be going anywhere for a while . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A29TNAVMPYFRDF	B000197KVW	3	Having moved on some time ago from his " I Want Your Sex " / " Faith " persona , George Michael has settled into being content with just releasing lush-sounding , sometimes monotonous , but occasionally interesting records every , oh , seven or eight years or so . <sssss> PATIENCE follows that pattern quite well , which is unfortunate as it makes listening somewhat of a chore in parts . <sssss> As with his last two albums , the singer focuses too heavily on languid , almost yawn-inducing ballads -- yes , they 're very pretty , but so is a newly painted house , at which point a quickie nap is favorable to watching the paint dry ( there 's a point in there somewhere ) . <sssss> The problem with George 's later balladry ( as opposed to the gorgeous " Father Figure " or " One More Try " ) has alot to do with melody , or maybe the lack thereof -- the newer material often not only sounds dull , but lazy as far as melody and hook are concerned . <sssss> His uptempo work remains his saving grace -- witness the world-class " Amazing " , " Flawless " , " Cars and Trains " , and the truly fantastic ( and slightly old-school-sounding-Michael ) " Freek " . <sssss> Overall , those who loved LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE or the snooze-inducing OLDER will probably be pleased , and those who miss the days of FAITH , well ...... . <sssss> waiting in vain is an often disheartening task .
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B000197KVW	5	" Patience " is George Michael 's first album release since " Songs From the Last Decade " five years ago . <sssss> He now returns with this monumental release , one of his best in his career . <sssss> Throughout this album , he proves that he 's greatly evolved as a musician since his 1984 debut with Wham ! <sssss> Few expected him to tie or surpass the quality of 1987 's " Faith " , which won the Grammy for Album of the Year . <sssss> He did . <sssss> Love him or hate him , he still knows how to keep everyone 's attention . <sssss> " Patience " explores a more mature side of George Michael that has never been explored . <sssss> Despite , he still has signature eyeopening moments that have caused controversy in the past . <sssss> Such themes earn him tremendous respect for expressing what few other musicians have dared , namely sex and sexual orientation . <sssss> His lyrics are more personal on this album . <sssss> Listeners can feel a sense of realism through every song with his performances , even the non-controversial tracks . <sssss> He expresses every word beautifully , whether they 're through ballads or dance tracks . <sssss> Through his words , he takes listeners on a wonderful journey through many aspects of his life , including coming out , his childhood , his time with Wham ! <sssss> , approaching 40 , and others . <sssss> These words are accompanied by a catchy or soulful background . <sssss> George Michael proves that he still knows how to write and produce quality songs . <sssss> Few other artists in modern-day mainstream have such talents . <sssss> The upbeat songs keep listeners dancing through every beat , including his introduced experimental techno sound on " Freeak ' 04 " . <sssss> The ballads have the smoothness that blend perfectly with his lyrics . <sssss> Such musical quality should keep audiences pleased with " Patience " . <sssss> This will always offer them a great unforgettable musical experience . <sssss> George Michael fans , new and old , and those wanting more should also buy his album " Ladies And Gentlemen : The Best of George Michael " , which compiles his greatest hits throughout his solo career . <sssss> *** Note : Expect George Michael to receive at least two Grammy nominations : Best Male Pop Performance ( " Amazing " ) and Best Pop Album .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000197KVW	4	George Michael titled his 1996 album Older . <sssss> He should have titled this Even Older for the album consistes mostly of ballads , which really is n't a bad thing actually , for he has a penchant with good emotive slow songs . <sssss> Opening the album is the brooding title track which brings to the current single , Amazing with its laid back and engaging mood . <sssss> No worries , though there are only a few uptempo , they are pretty good . <sssss> Flawless Go City is hail-back to disco 70 's ala high-brow OTT Pet Shop Boys . <sssss> Cars and Trains is a funky song with an infectious backing track . <sssss> Freeek ! <sssss> 04 is a self-reminder of the toilet episode but still comes off as being a good dance track . <sssss> Great to see Michael back on form .
A3I675GA2O8I59	B000197KVW	5	GEORGE announced to the BBC that this CD would be his last commercial venture available to the public via music retailers . <sssss> He returns to the umbrella of the SONY label just in time to deliver a product that is both intelligent and musically powerful . <sssss> MICHAEL possesses one of the best male vocals on the planet and he has always been a genius at painting portraits with musical arrangements . <sssss> The tracks on this CD are musically matured , political in nature yet catchy with strong hooks . <sssss> SHOOT THE DOG is unfortunately the weakest track on the CD but the lyrical importance of the ANTI-BUSH message is educational and brilliant . <sssss> If you love intelligent pop music that is at times shocking , you 'll adore this release . <sssss> PATIENCE is worth purchasing , owning and adding to your collection . <sssss> If I could award this CD 10 stars I would , it is that ingenious !
A3RC3AK8UN89I9	B000197KVW	4	A long wait for new material from George Michael . <sssss> It 's a solid album , he has a great voice and a good ear for what works . <sssss> However , it sounds a lot like his other albums . <sssss> He does n't really grow or expand with each new release . <sssss> It is a safe bet , but it would be nice for him to experiment a bit more . <sssss> His last official album ( so he says ) . <sssss> Highlights include Flawless , Precious Box , Freeek 04 , Patience , Cars and Trains , and My Mother Had A Brother .
A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	B000197KVW	4	At first , I was skeptical about buying this CD because of the pretty plain cover and pictures on the front / back of the album . <sssss> By the end of the day on Tuesday , I changed my mind and decided to go ahead and give it a try . <sssss> Boy , am I glad I did ! <sssss> This CD is really good ... . <sssss> and George still sounds great after so long from being out of the spotlight . <sssss> This is his first set of new material in 8 years , but the themes and songs fit right in to what the musical landscape is featuring today . <sssss> The highlight of the whole disc is FLAWLESS , an excellent dance number that will get your booty shakin ' and your feet movin ' ! <sssss> I really hope they release this song as a single with a bunch of great remixes ! <sssss> I would love to see what Love to Infinity , or maybe the Passengerz or Almighty , could do to this song . <sssss> Other than that , there are some really good ballads too ... . <sssss> and I am really disturbed that Sony / Epic would choose to purposefully censor this album because of the anti-war message in " Shoot The Dog " . <sssss> I think this album should be reissued here with the extra song . <sssss> I was very surprised about this album , and it 's nice to see an artist come back from the musical ashes to take everyone by storm ... again !
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B000197KVW	2	In his first CD of originals since 1996s listless ' Older ' , we find George Michael reading through his journals - he 's happily in love with his Texas beau , he mourns the suicide of his gay uncle at an unfortunate time in gay-history , and he appears to have passed the humiliation of that little Will Rogers Memorial Park men 's room incident . <sssss> While we are happy for his love life [ and we could assume he 'll be okay after his recent drug arrest ] and to just hear him croon again , we could have - should have - expected anything more current sounding than the cornball confessionals , drippy ballads and narcoleptic mid-tempo dance ditties he 's pumped out for almost 2 decades . <sssss> Welcome to the millennium , George . <sssss> Long live 1987 . <sssss> My grade : C +
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000197KVW	5	PATIENCE is George Michael 's first album of new original material since 1996 's OLDER . <sssss> He released a collection of standards in 2000 titled SONGS FROM THE LAST CENTURY , but this marks his first album of new music . <sssss> A year or two ago , a few new tracks surfaced . <sssss> " Freeek " and " Shoot The Dog " , the latter is not on this album deemed too controversial with it 's anti-Bush message . <sssss> Shame because it 's a great track . <sssss> The first single from this new album is " Amazing " , which is a great uptempo song . <sssss> In fact , I was quite pleased with the material on this disc . <sssss> There 's a nice balance of ballads , and dance tracks . <sssss> Favorites include " Through " , " Cars and Trains " , " Precious Box " , and many others . <sssss> If you like his past work , you 'll like this one too .
A3SV72ZAHH2IDH	B000197KVW	3	Credit for George Michael for having the patience when he makes album , since " Wham " split up he 's been far from mass producing albums and it was now 7 years ago since " Older " was released . <sssss> Credit for him for beeing a very gifted songwriter that always has a meaning with his songs , back in the 80 's / early 90 's he also had great melodies , something that is rare these days . <sssss> AntiWars songs like " Patience " and " John and Elvis are dead " are good lyrically but utterly boring . <sssss> The third antiWar song inclucded " Shoot the Dog " which was already released two years ago however is good , it 's faster with a nice melody . <sssss> Mid tempo soulish " Amazing " is indeed amazing , and one of the album 's best tracks . <sssss> " Cars and Trains " falls flat , too beat oriented . <sssss> " Freek " and " Flawless " which are both meliodic and uptempo reminds me of what George can do in his best moments but there are to many slow songs that lacks a melody and hook here . <sssss> " Round Here " is ok , a quite slow song but interesting , reminds me a bit of " Father Figure " . <sssss> " American Angel " is also slow but allright too . <sssss> The rest of the songs i have n't mentioned are n't anything special . <sssss> This album reminds me of " Older " , it 's allright but far from a solid George Michael Album full of nice melodies and hooks . <sssss> it got it 's moments but commerically it 's no success .
AFPQVUEI3D46K	B000197KVW	3	I 've been a fan of George 's since that mind-rotting song " Wake Me Up Before You Go Go " . <sssss> Man , you ca n't get it out of your head !! <sssss> I 've purchased all of GM 's recordings , including this one , but I 'm the least happy with this one . <sssss> Here 's why : I think the material on this CD is pretty weak . <sssss> Not that it is not good , but it 's weak . <sssss> There are three exceptions though , that make this album tollerable : John And Elvis Are Dead ( excellent song ! <sssss> my favorite on the CD ) , Flawless ( a truly gay anthem with a techno dance flair ) and Freeek 04 ! <sssss> ( a steamy song about everyone 's favorite activty - hehe ) . <sssss> Otherwise , it 's a bit off . <sssss> George has such a powerful voice and it sadly does n't get showcased enough on this recording . <sssss> If this is truly GM 's last studio album , I 'll be sad . <sssss> I think his final release should be an upbeat dance album . <sssss> Even if he has to do a few covers , he can pull it off . <sssss> I 'd much rather remember him as going out on TOP , rather than just going out .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B000197KVW	5	' Patience ' is a very deep , personal , sometimes dark cd from George Michael , his first of all new material ( well not counting ' Freeek ' and ' Shoot the dog ' ) in years and years . <sssss> It is well worth the wait . <sssss> You can see a lot of care and attention went into this release , including the brilliant cd photos . <sssss> The songs are largely autobiographical . <sssss> ' Round here ' harks back to his early years growing up . <sssss> ' American Angel ' is an upbeat , bouncy , mid tempo ode to his Texan lover . <sssss> ' Flawless ' and ' Precious box ' are uptempo stompers that will get your feet moving . <sssss> Deep , razor sharp basslines and a great dance beat . <sssss> The highlights have got to be the sunny , upbeat , optimistic ' Amazing ' , with a great line that says ' I think it 's amazing , the way that love can set you free ' . <sssss> True . <sssss> ' My mother had a brother ' is another outstanding song . <sssss> A ballad with very vivid , moving lyrics , full of pain and love for a gay uncle he never met ; he killed himself the same day George Michael was born . <sssss> The album does take repeated plays before it 's full beauty is revealed but when it does ... <sssss> Fantastic !
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B000197KVW	5	George Michael makes a great modern day pop album with Patience . <sssss> I will admit some of the songs are alittle on the adult side as far as being slow . <sssss> But a few of the tracks are great pop / club songs . <sssss> Freek ! <sssss> has to be the track that stood out to me most . <sssss> It 's very resmicent of Kylie Minogue 's Speakerphone . <sssss> There 's alot of synth with a mix of quirky and weird music . <sssss> Car and Trains is an intersting track . <sssss> I also loved Flawless Great Dance Pop song ! <sssss> It gets really good towards the end . <sssss> This def . <sssss> a versitale album , which i think helped it sell . <sssss> It 's got a great range of of music on this album ! <sssss> George Michael knows how to pick really great music , and that 's way this album has sold millions in the us and around the world ! <sssss> If you love pop music or r and b then this def . <sssss> an album for for you !
AE31M52VLKOG6	B000197KVW	5	George Michael is back with an excellent CD . <sssss> Amazing is a great dance hit about how being in love with someone can turn your life around . <sssss> This song is really about a celebration of love . <sssss> Flawless is a good techno dance song about having confidence in yourself . <sssss> My Mother had a Brother is a sad song about the suicide of George 's uncle . <sssss> This is a very touching personal track . <sssss> I really liked it . <sssss> Please Send Me Someone is a pleasant song dedicated to George 's lover Anselmo . <sssss> George wrote this song to tell his fans that he is finally happy with his life . <sssss> Cars and Trains is another one of my favorite songs . <sssss> It has thoughtful lyrics about how people can make wrong decisions in life and get caught in bad and often destructive relationships . <sssss> Patience is the album George Michael fans have been waiting for . <sssss> The subject matter on this album is more mature and serious . <sssss> George sounds great too !
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000197KVW	4	The title of George Michael 's new solo album obviously refers to the patience with which we 've waited for this CD , his first since 1996 's " Older " . <sssss> It 's not as consistent as that record , but it does feature some of Michael 's most personal and inspired work . <sssss> There are some great tunes , a few good ones , and a couple boring ones , resulting in an overall worthwhile effort . <sssss> The kickoff single , " Amazing " , is an unpretentious , guitar flavored pop single that deserved its Top Ten status in Britain . <sssss> " Flawless ( Go to the City ) " is a flamboyant , 6-minute disco stomper that has the word " hit " all over it , and " American Angel " is a touching love song about his Texas boyfriend . <sssss> Every George Michael CD has at least one tearjerker of a ballad , and on this CD , that song is definitely " My Mother Had a Brother " , which addresses the suicide of his uncle . <sssss> If this track does n't make you misty in the eyes , you better make sure you still have a pulse . <sssss> And , of course , there are the already-released singles " Freeek " ! <sssss> ( about getting your freak online ) and " Shoot the Dog " ( a candid antiwar diatribe against George W. Bush and Tony Blair ) . <sssss> But at 70 minutes , it seems a bit weighed down by filler tracks like " Cars and Trains " and " Round Here " . <sssss> It 's a shame that George 's career in America is all but forgotten because this CD deserves to be as much a hit on these shores as the UK , where it already went to Number One . <sssss> It 's not perfect , but make no mistake : this " Patience " is a virtue .
A1XPTVJC8OMM3I	B0002S94RK	5	Jill Scott is one shining gem ! <sssss> Her rich , silky , soulful voice adds so much beauty to this untouchable disc . <sssss> Talent like this ca n't be taught . <sssss> Jill was put on this earth to be a soul singer , PERIOD ! <sssss> The album as a whole is superb , like her first album , and worth every penny . <sssss> I love the vibes , the jazz , the soul ; hell , I love everything about it ! <sssss> Experience the pure pleasure of Ms. Scott 's music . <sssss> Music this soulful and retro is as authentic as it gets - and few can compete with Jill 's level of artistry . <sssss> If you are by chance not a Soul / R & B fan , you will be after listening to this album . <sssss> Beautiful music from a beautiful singer . <sssss> DIVINE EAR CANDY !
A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	B0002S94RK	5	It 's been four years since Jill Scott amazed the world with her album " Who Is Jill Scott : Words And Sounds Vol . 1 " . <sssss> She earned four Grammy nominations including Best New Artist , which she was wrongfully snubbed by Shelby Lynne . <sssss> Now , she is back with a new long-awaited album " Beautifully Human : Words And Sounds Vol . 2 " . <sssss> Such tremendous quality proves that she was working throughout the four-year interval . <sssss> Now , she records , writes , and produces her songs in a new style . <sssss> While still combining R&B ; , jazz , and contemporary music , she mellows her sound considerably . <sssss> Regardless how much of each is more expressed in the individual song , she remains on top in every note . <sssss> Every song has its own unique flavor that attracts audiences to them . <sssss> The album 's variety keeps the listening experience while never shying away from her trueness . <sssss> More than the music background offers great emotional value . <sssss> Her lyrics continue to express inner strength like she did on her previous album . <sssss> Though less blunt , they remain equally powerful . <sssss> Scott 's various vocal expressions blend beautifully with the music . <sssss> Her songs never fade with age . <sssss> Jill Scott proves that she is a true talent that will continue to shine for many more years . <sssss> " Beautifully Human : Words And Sounds Vol . 2 " is highly recommended for any R&B ; listener . <sssss> This is sure to please its audiences for a long time .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B0002S94RK	4	I was reading through some of the reviews and laughed out loud at the one who stated that he / she was hoping to " get their nod on " while listening to Jill 's album . <sssss> I bought her new album with no expectations or comparisons to the first so maybe that 's why I was grateful for the new music . <sssss> My favorite song no doubt is " My Petition " and getting to see her perform it live on Tavis Smiley 's show was a definite treat . <sssss> I truly enjoyed the entire album and am happy that Jill Scott is another artist who continues to " do her " and is not dictated to by what 's hot at the moment . <sssss> Fans of her music , I believe are fans of true music - I think I 'll be listening to Jill 's music 5-10 years from now just like I listen to Minnie Ripperton , Phyllis Hyman , Stephanie Mills and Anita Baker . <sssss> These women and others that I did n't mention make music to listen to , not music to gyrate in a video to ... <sssss> The reason for the 4.5 rating is because the only song that I relate to but do not like is " Rasool " - no doubt we all have a Rasool or two in our lives but the song was a little heavy-handed for me and even after 5 + listens , I still want to skip ove this particular song .
A28FNKCGFS03VL	B0002S94RK	3	Jill Scott is one artist who definitely bends over backwards trying not to be a clone of anyone else , which is something that she did so well on her first album that the follow-up was n't likely to be as good , and unfortunately it is n't . <sssss> " Cross My Mind " is a great song , and that signature hauntingness still pops up in some places , but trying to create something as solid and flawless as " Who Is Jill Scott ... " is something that even Jill herself ca n't quite pull off . <sssss> I would give this four stars instead of three if " Golden " had n't been the big hit . <sssss> Unfortunately , that song lacks the character of a truly great Jill Scott song ( and is n't half as good as " Cross My Mind " ) . <sssss> It sounds like it could have been made by anybody .
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B0002S94RK	5	Here we are with Jill scott for Vol . <sssss> 2 of her musical Journey . <sssss> Now that we know " Who is Jill scott " . <sssss> Now its time to really see how Jill is Just beautifully Human . <sssss> On this Jill explores all the human qualities that make us just that ( Beautifully Human ) . <sssss> Love , family , marriage , first love , memories , and Life in general are some of the topics that Jill cross this time around . <sssss> Any fan of the first cd should definetly pick this one up . <sssss> What tracks are good ? <sssss> * Im not afraid * Golden * The fact is * Cross my mind -- One of the best tracks here * Bedda at home - Qtip and Jill rock this track * talk to me -- nice twist at the end how the song changes * Family reunion -- helps to paint a nice picutre * Whatever * My petetion * I keepThese songs right here are what make this cd what it is . <sssss> They all paint a picture in some way where you can actually invision what she is talkign about . <sssss> whether its a past experience of yours or someone elses , every song has something most can relate to . <sssss> Family reunion is a good example of how well she is able to create these pics with her words . <sssss> When you listen you can actually imagine your own family reunion becasue certain things in all families are all the same . <sssss> Overall Jill did not dissapoint this time around . <sssss> This cd might not hit you as strong as the first cd at first listen ... . <sssss> but after that you will like it just as much if not more . <sssss> Get it !
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B0002S94RK	5	Not as great as her debut in my opinion , but still a brilliant and outstanding CD , demonstrating why Jill Scott is a leader in the crowded Neo Soul field . <sssss> Lyrically , she is still up there as is evident on the superb half spoken ' Cross my mind ' ( a beautiful tale about remembering times shared with a past lover which deservedly won a Grammy ) and ' Family reunion ' ( another spoken tale , this time a hilarious take on a family get together , fondly listing various family members ' quirks ) which features some dreamy backing vocals weaving in and out over a party sound background . <sssss> Other standouts are ' Rasool ' , a violent tale about some kid called Rasool , which despite the subject matter is a tender retro sounding ballad with some Marvin Gaye-ish backing vocals flittering in and out . <sssss> Awesome ! <sssss> There 's the stunning semi-operatic ' Still here ' ( sung in a higher key and featuring ghostly sounding operatic backing vocals , delicate piano tinkerings and tender guitar strumming ) , ' Whatever ' ( a retro sounding tale of the previous night 's passion ) , the jazzy ' Talk to me ' ( which kicks into a big band style number about mid way through ) . <sssss> ' Bedda at home ' featuring some really outstanding vocal acrobatics ( where she retorts to a guy tempting her that she 's got something better at home , set to a hip hop beat and great piano playing towards the end ) and the upbeat , self assertive ' Golden ' . <sssss> Classy , joyous , soulful ! <sssss> There is a glow present , almost a golden glow , I guess from her being in love and it shines through this brilliant disc .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B0002S94RK	5	Jill Scott is a very talented singer and songwriter . <sssss> Beautifully Human is an excellent album . <sssss> The best song is the first single Golden . <sssss> It is a great song about embracing your freedom and living life to the fullest . <sssss> Family reunion is another highlight for me on this album . <sssss> This song makes me think of my own family and how I enjoy their company and good food . <sssss> Jill sounds soulful and very nostalgic on this track , and I loved it . <sssss> The other standout track is Bedda at Home . <sssss> This song is about resisting temptation from other men and staying faithful to your partner . <sssss> Bedda at Home is definitely one of those songs that gets your body moving . <sssss> I really enjoyed it . <sssss> Ca n't Explain is a very smooth and pretty song about not being able to explain why a person was not faithful to their partner . <sssss> I love these two songs , and I enjoyed listening to their opposite messages . <sssss> Cross your Mind is another favorite song of mine . <sssss> thinking about an ex boyfriend and remembering the good and bad things about the relationship . <sssss> My Petition is a song about the difficulty people some have in a relationship with . <sssss> trusting each other Jill sounds very melodic and sensual on this track . <sssss> Her phrasing is so crisp and clear . <sssss> I could really relate to the lyrics of most of these songs , because they talk about different aspects of being in love . <sssss> I really enjoyed listening to Beautifully Human , and I highly recommend it .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B0002S94RK	5	It was never a question of whether I 'd get Jill Scott 's " Beautifully Human " . <sssss> Rather , it was a question of when and how quickly . <sssss> Her fantastic 2000 debut was a potent collection of sharp lyrics and jazzy soulful beats that earned her a Grammy nomination . <sssss> That record gave me high expectations , and I 'm glad to report that " Beautifully Human " meets them . <sssss> Here , Scott employs the winning formula of her last album and takes it to another level . <sssss> Of course , the single " Golden " and " Family Reunion " are two popular favorites that are standouts on the album , but my personal favorites are " ( The Fact Is ) I Need You " , " My Petition " , the butter-smooth " Ca n't Explain " , and " Cross My Mind " , in which Jill vividly recalls an ex-lover . <sssss> It 's been 4 long years since we 've last heard from Scott , but " Beautifully Human " makes the wait all the more worthwhile .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B0002S94RK	4	This album is not quite as excellent as her debut album , but it is still superb . <sssss> Very nice album . <sssss> It is a little more laid-back and free flowing than Words & Sounds , Volume 1 . <sssss> Every song on here is great . <sssss> I especially like " Rasool " , " Bedda At Home " and " Family Reunion " . <sssss> Jill 's subject matter on here is very refreshing ... who else sings about a family reunion , the food each family member brings and the fights they get in ? <sssss> This is an excellent CD . <sssss> I highly encourage you to buy this wonderful album !
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B000AOENCM	4	First off here 's the CORRECT track listing : 1 . <sssss> I Know Why2 . <sssss> Perfect Lie3 . <sssss> Good Is Good4 . <sssss> Chances Are5 . <sssss> Wildflower6 . <sssss> Lifetimes7 . <sssss> Letter To God8 . <sssss> Live It Up9 . <sssss> I Do n't Wan na Know10 . <sssss> Always On Your Side11 . <sssss> Where Has All The Love Gone ? <sssss> Like I said this CD is a bit slower with a lot of slow songs and mid-tempos . <sssss> Lifetimes and Live It Up are pretty much the only upbeat tracks here . <sssss> I Know Why starts things off good . <sssss> Perfect Lie continues things but then the catchy rhythm of Good Is Good comes in . <sssss> Chances Are , the fourth track , slows things down again . <sssss> Nice lyrics though . <sssss> Lifetimes , the first actual upbeat track is probably my favorite track here . <sssss> It starts off slow , minimal and pure , but then picks up in instrumentation . <sssss> " Even in the worst of times , I give my best to you " . <sssss> Sheryl repeats . <sssss> Nice lyrics . <sssss> Letter To God kinda comes and goes . <sssss> But Live It Up is very upbeat and fun . <sssss> " You get high-jacked , waiting at the bus stopBy Jesus , who 's working at the pawn shop " ! <sssss> haha . <sssss> I 'll admit the next track I Do n't Wan na Know if basically filler . <sssss> So skip that one and keep on truckin ' . <sssss> Always On Your Side is better . <sssss> The closer , Where Has All The Love Gone ? <sssss> is decent . <sssss> It makes for a nice , mid-tempo ending .4 stars . <sssss> end note : Best tracks ( to download ) : LifetimesWildflowerGood Is GoodPerfect LieChances Are
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B000AOENCM	3	I have been a Sheryl Crow fan ever since she used to background for Michael Jackson . <sssss> When she secured a career of her own , she dropped plenty of classic or near-classic albums like Tuesday Night Music Club , C'mon C'mon and her self-titled album . <sssss> Aside from The Globe Sessions , which got mixed reviews , I never had to think twice about giving one of her albums a high rating . <sssss> But her latest , Wildflower , did n't turn out to be as fresh as I 'd hoped . <sssss> The lead single " Good Is Good " is good is good -- WHAT 'D I say ? <sssss> Anyway , aside from that song and possibly " I Know Why " , the lyrical quality makes you wonder if Sheryl ran out of ideas . <sssss> As other reviewers have mentioned , most of the songs are mellow , and in the words of a hit off her first album , they ai n't strong enough . <sssss> Songs like " Lifetimes " and " Chances Are " really do n't go anywhere , and " Perfect Lie " could stand a rewrite or two . <sssss> " I Do n't Wan na Know " also has her hitting some odd notes during the chorus . <sssss> Surprisingly , the fast songs are n't that great either : " Live It Up " kind of comes off as the kind of song you 'd hear from a pop star that was trying to cross over into contemporary rock . <sssss> Basically , I 'm still a devoted Sheryl Crow fan , but I advise everyone to only buy Wildflower for the same reason I bought it : to complete your Sheryl Crow collection . <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A2EL3990HXOMZB	B000AOENCM	5	With " Wildflower " , Sheryl Crow once again deliberately avoided hot new trends , replacing them with solid , smooth , mature , and most importantly , beautiful effort . <sssss> The result is one almost perfect album , with emphasis on moody , generous-sounding and soothing songs . <sssss> Those small charms of the tracks do n't grow on you as quickly as you might like , but the rewards are all the better for it . <sssss> The first three songs summarize the feel of the CD very well , being rather similar in tempo but equally different and beautiful in their own way . <sssss> On " Chances Are " , the artist chooses a trip-hoppy path treaded so well with " Safe and Sound " from the 2002 " C'mon C'mon " . <sssss> And the fabulous " Always on Your Side " ( soon afterwards remade as a duet with Sting ) deserves to go down as one of the most gorgeous songs of early stages of this millennium . <sssss> All in all , " Wildflower " is a suitable antidote to Sheryl 's most daring eponymous album ( 1996 ) and a class act from start to finish .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000AOENCM	5	Sheryl Crow returns to the music scene with her first studio album since 2002 's C'MON C'MON . <sssss> She recorded two albums in 2005 , this one , and a more pop album that is due next year . <sssss> This is her " artist " record as she described it . <sssss> There is some great stuff on here . <sssss> Two songs really stand out for me on this album , including the title track which celebrates the fact that good things can come from anywhere . <sssss> " Chances Are " is another moving track . <sssss> It was initially found as a b-side to the " Soak Up The Sun " single 3 years ago . <sssss> Sheryl added a few strings and added it to this album . <sssss> It 's a beautiful song and lyrically one of the best she 's written in my opinion . <sssss> " Good Is Good " is the first single and it is classic Sheryl Crow . <sssss> It has a catchy hook and great lyrics . <sssss> " Lifetimes " and " Live It Up " are instantly catchy as well . <sssss> While Sheryl has always made amazing music that is thought provoking , WILDFLOWER is all that and much more too . <sssss> Other highlights include " Always On Your Side " , " Where Has All The Love Gone " and " Perfect Lie " . <sssss> Definately worth having in your music collection !
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN	B000AOENCM	3	With her fifth album , " Wildflower " , Shery Crow sinks deeper into bland adult contemporary fodder . <sssss> She does n't seem willing to challenge her audience intellectually or creatively anymore like she did with her first two albums , 1993 's " Tuesday Night Music Club " and 1996 's " Sheryl Crow " . <sssss> Instead , she offers up mostly mid-tempo and rather dull music set to fairly decent lyrics . <sssss> There 's nothing here that will grab you the way " All I Wan na Do " did , or even more recently , the way " Soak Up The Sun " did . <sssss> As with every Crow album there are some diamonds to keep such as " Chances Are " with its more intimate , thoughtful and hushed arrangement . <sssss> " Letter To God " is likewise memorable . <sssss> " Always On Your Side " is pretty heartfelt and interesting too . <sssss> However , " Live It Up " the albums sole rocker is has solid versus complimented with a horrid chorus . <sssss> " Lifetimes " is the only other song that reaches a more rock tempo , and it 's not that memorable . <sssss> " Where Has All The Love Gone " reminded me of Black Eyed Peas ' " Where Is The Love " ? <sssss> from last year . <sssss> It just seems , with her recent marriage to Lance Armstrong , that there should have been more here to inspire us . <sssss> Crow does n't sound very inspired lyrically or musically with this one . <sssss> I 'm afraid this is just a developing patter since 2002 's " C'mon C'mon " was n't too interesting either . <sssss> I think after 12 years Sheryl could try to experiment more with her sound . <sssss> She 's already proven herself with the type of music found on " Wildflower " . <sssss> I just found this album disappointing and unmemorable after repeated listens . <sssss> Maybe next time .
A1OSWSG4YXN8KJ	B000AOENCM	2	From the debutante annoyance of the shrill ' Tuesday Night Music Club ' to surpassing expectations with the non-sophomore slump of the excellent ' Sheryl Crow ' to the ambivalence and skill of ' Globe Sessions ' - well , it 's been downhill ever since . <sssss> She 's long ago morphed from a debutante to watch to a major nuisance . <sssss> She 's not only lost her voice , but she 's here to prove that there 's a clich&eacute; born every minute , and we 're the suckers buying into it . <sssss> She 's never been more formulaic or mediocre . <sssss> My grade : C -
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000AOENCM	5	Sheryl Crow returns with WILDFLOWER , an introspective piece of music that reflects her life at this point . <sssss> Many people say it 's a happier album , but I beg to differ . <sssss> Yes , there are more positive songs , but there are still songs about love gone wrong and other problems ( such as " I Do n't Wan na Know " , " Perfect Lie " , etc ) . <sssss> The album is very good . <sssss> My favorite song is " Chances Are " which was previously a b-side . <sssss> The title track is great too . <sssss> Other highlights include " I Know Why " , " Good Is Good " , and " Always On Your Side " .
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B000AOENCM	3	especially if it inspires you to make this type of music . <sssss> As a fan of Ms. Crow , I am very happy that she finally found peace in her personal life . <sssss> But compared to her previous cds , this music is quite bland . <sssss> Her lyrics are still great , but they do n't jump out at you like they used to . <sssss> You find yourself drifting away and not noticing that you are actually listening to music . <sssss> Maybe because Sheryl had less control over the music . <sssss> If you study her credit sheet , you will notice she was less involved in her music this time around , allowing others to have more control . <sssss> I also knew something was wrong when I saw " Chances Are " listed as a song . <sssss> Most hardcore fans will already know that she recorded that song for Cmon Cmon and released it as a B-side to " Soak Up The Sun " on the International single release . <sssss> It 's hard to dismiss this cd because it 's still ranks far above than most music today , but it seems that Sheryl has hit a creative block . <sssss> It happens ... even to the best artists like Sheryl .
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B000AOENCM	3	When Sheryl Crow released her fifth studio album in September , 2005 , things could n't have been peachier for her : a million-selling music career , and her very public romance with Lance Armstrong ( their engagement was announced that same month ) . <sssss> We 're now seven months later , and Sheryl is single again ( circumstances behind the break-up are still fuzzy ) , and " Wildflowers " is the first flop in Sheryl 's stellar career . <sssss> What went wrong ? <sssss> " Wildflower " ( 11 tracks , 46 min . <sssss> ) is the complete opposite of Sheryl 's previous studio album " C'mon C'mon " . <sssss> Gone are the cheery , sunny , catchy songs , and instead we receive introspective songs , with Sheryl reflecting on how good life basically is . <sssss> The opener " I Know Why " sets the tone for the album . <sssss> The title track is just Sheryl on acoustic guitar , with sparse strings accompannying her . <sssss> " Lifetimes " and " Live It Up " are the only uptempo songs on the album . <sssss> " Always on Your Side " is a beautiful piano-based ballad . <sssss> So why has " Wildflower " been a chart disappointment ? <sssss> For the answer , look no further than " Good is Good " , the radio single . <sssss> It is not a bad song per se , but it does n't grab you . <sssss> And that 's pretty reflective of the entire album . <sssss> A lot of easy-flowing songs with not enough attention-grabbers . <sssss> The liner notes ' prominent dedication to Lance , and the plentyful references to love in the songs , now come across awkwardly , frankly .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B000AOENCM	4	Sheryl Crow has every reason to be happy . <sssss> She 's at the peak of her musical game and she 's engaged to Lance Armstrong . <sssss> One would think that her next album would be full of songs dedicated to the happiness of life and love . <sssss> Wildflower is not that record . <sssss> It is a string-laden and filled with lovelorn ballads . <sssss> The orchestration is beautiful and the lyrics contain Ms. Crow 's usual sharp incites . <sssss> The album is n't as immediate as her other works , the songs are deeper and darker . <sssss> There is one exception , the ultra-catchy and upbeat " Live It Up " which has a great chorus and vocal . <sssss> " Chances Are " has a pretty melody build around an acoustic guitar and tabla , " Perfect Lie " has a torch song feel and the title track has a folk vibe . <sssss> " Lifetimes " has a rock edge , though it is not a rocker . <sssss> The best track on the album is the gorgeous " Always On Your Side " . <sssss> It has an achingly beautiful melody with a sparse arrangement and maybe the bets vocal of Ms. Crow 's career .
A1OJQAJ16T36VJ	B000BNTM32	2	To say that this is Mary 's best work is offensive and defaming to a legacy that Blige has worked over 15 years to create . <sssss> Mary usually delivers fairly decent material , but her last two albums , 2003 's Love & Life & 2005 's The Breakthrough are lackluster and average at best . <sssss> The Breakthrough ca n't hold a candle to 1999 's Mary or 2001 's No More Drama , nevermind even being considered for contention to her finest material to date , 1997 's Share my World . <sssss> The album seems rushed , uninspiried and way to formula-driven . <sssss> The lead single " Be Without You " however can be placed among Blige 's finer works . <sssss> The piano tingled soul number features an impressive vocal display as well as one of the catchiest melodies of recent memories . <sssss> Elsewhere , Blige 's pipes shine on " Say Lady " and a nice cover of U2 's " One " , which could have been so much better had it not included re-recorded vocals by Bono . <sssss> Other than that the album falters . <sssss> The previously unreleased but heavily leaked " MJB Da MVP " leads the pack of awful filler , followed closely by " Ca n't Hide From Love " featuring a normally stellar Jay-Z and " Take Me as I Am " . <sssss> Tracks like " Father in You " and " Good Woman Down " would have come off much better if they were n't so damn preachy . <sssss> Blige is trying to force feed us the new found " maturity " in her music inspired by her 2003 marriage . <sssss> Needless to say , I 'm not buying it . <sssss> Vocally she is one of the best singers to come around in decades , but she seems to be running out of hit potential quickly . <sssss> Possibly , she should take a look at the career of rumored rival Faith Evans who just gets better with time .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B000BNTM32	5	The Breakthrough ~ Mary J. Blige is a real well done album . <sssss> The sound is crisp and the studio production is top notch . <sssss> Ms Blige has amazing vocal skills and the lyrics are well written and heart felt without sounding forced or contrite . <sssss> The book-let is very nice but I am perplexed by the decision to make it fold like a poster and gets minus points . <sssss> Ms Blige is a very beautifull woman but some of the outfits make her look a bit too ghetto and that does not fit a lady . <sssss> The cover photo is absolutely stunning and she looks like a greek goddess . <sssss> I highly recommend this album to fans of good r & b and to good music in general .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B000BNTM32	5	Mary J. Blige has been making classic album after classic album fore the past decade and a half and her newest effort is definitely one of her best efforts yet and could arguably be her best cd . <sssss> Mary J. Blige is undoubtedly the queen of R&B & soul music because no one brings it quite like this . <sssss> Every song is great and memorable and vocally she sounds amazing rivaling the work done on her debut . <sssss> The songwriting is of course good and the production is top notch . <sssss> Every son is so good that it is hard to pick a favorite song but if I had to I 'd say Ca n't Get Enough or I Found My Everything but every song is noteworthy . <sssss> There 's really nothing else to be said ... this album is simply put , a must have , a classic . <sssss> Mary J. Blige displays on The Breakthrough why she is so loved . <sssss> You should already have this album .
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	B000BNTM32	4	I 've had this disc since its release day back in December but honestly was so stuck on my favorite single , BE WITHOUT YOU that I had not listened to it in entirety till within this month ! <sssss> Whoever decided to release that single 1st should be given a marketing medal because it was the kind of " knock em out the box " single that Mary needed to bring full attention to her upcoming release . <sssss> As a fan I enjoyed her last studio release in 2003 but it was considered a flop by many because her initial single did not really turn into a hit that people expect from MJB then in desperation , three singles were quickly released during the summer months but none really caught fire with the public like BE WITHOUT YOU did / has . <sssss> This is a very good album from start to finish with more than a few strong single tracks & 2 tracks that I deemed " filler " . <sssss> Other than the aforementioned , BE WITHOUT YOU , my other favorite tracks are : MJB DA MVP - magnificently covers her 14 + years in the industry and chronicles briefly critics ' opinions of each releaseCA N'T HIDE FROM LOVE - I swear she was channeling Aretha Franklin on this one ! <sssss> ALONE - beautiful duetAI N'T REALLY LOVE - classic MJB joint , loved the string arrangementIn my personal MJB album ranking system , this ranks a strong 5th behind : MY LIFE , MARY , SHARE MY WORLD , WHAT 'S THE 411 but miles ahead of NO MORE DRAMA ! <sssss> Fans should n't be disappointed in this strong effort from the Queen of Hip Hop / Soul !
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW	B000BNTM32	5	What we have here is hip-hop soul extrodinare Mary J giving us another dose of her take on heartache and pain and just life . <sssss> The end result is a classic ... . <sssss> an unexpected classic that I consider one of her best cd 's to date and also most sucessfull thus far . <sssss> Mary debuted with sales of over 700K in the first week which is way over any first week sales she has done thus far in her career . <sssss> This time around she works with different producers like Will.I.am , raaphael saadiq , Jimmy jam and Terry L among others . <sssss> I think that workign with raaphael brings out the most soulful part of her ... . <sssss> they should do more together . <sssss> All these things together is what really makes this album " The breakthrough " . <sssss> Now to the songs ... . <sssss> whats really good ? <sssss> ... everything for the most part . <sssss> So i 'll list my personal favorites ... . <sssss> which are : * No One will Do - If anyone listens to Neyo 's new cd and pays attention . <sssss> they actually sample the same song . <sssss> On neyo 's cd the song is " It just aint right " . <sssss> * About you * Enough Cryin * Gon na Breakthrough - Hot beat * Baggage * Cant Hide from Luv * I found my everything * Alone * OneOverall thats my favorite tracks in a nutshell as well as the tracks I think you should really check for . <sssss> There is also a bonus track that is pretty good too but im not sure what the name of it is . <sssss> Any fan of mary should of had this already . <sssss> NOn-fans who like good R+B / hip-hop Soul music should get this . <sssss> The Mary this time around is a more mature mary giving you a mix of her best momments in one disc . <sssss> Get it !
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000BNTM32	4	I 've been a Mary J Blige fan for years now , and I have n't been moved by one of her albums like this since 1999 's MARY . <sssss> This is her best album since then . <sssss> Mary brings the heat on THE BREAKTHROUGH ! <sssss> On this CD she really sings , instead of the histronics we are used to hearing from her . <sssss> There 's a nice mix of uptempos , and downtempo ballads . <sssss> Some of my favorites include " Be Without You " , " No One Will Do " , " Father In You " , " Alone " , " Ai n't Really Love " , and more . <sssss> Overall I 'm happy to say Mary is back !
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000BNTM32	5	I have n't enjoyed a Mary J Blige album this much since her 1999 MARY album . <sssss> This seems to be a really personal album for Mary , but in many of the songs she channels this into making anthems . <sssss> The first single " Be Without You " is instantly catchy , classic R&B ballad . <sssss> The first 8 tracks of this cd are amazing , notably the opener " No One Will Do " , the anthems " Gon na Breakthrough " and " Good Woman Down " , and " Enough Cryin " . <sssss> On " Enough Cryin " and " Gon na Breakthrough " , Mary raps . <sssss> They are hot songs ! <sssss> I hope " Enough Cryin " is a single at some point . <sssss> The latter part of the disc is much more ballad oriented , with some great ones like " Father In You " , " Ai n't Really Love " , and " I Found My Everything " . <sssss> Overall a great cd !
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000BNTM32	3	what happens if Mary J. Bliege entered Mariah Carey 's world ? <sssss> well the lead off single & the overall vibe leads you to that mindset . <sssss> I dig Old Mary 's stuff , but Vocally I ca n't tolerate Her singing anymore . <sssss> vocally She gets on my nerves . <sssss> this Album is better produced than her Previous last 2-3 . <sssss> song Selection has 2-3 real winners here . <sssss> at this stage of Her career the overall presentation means more . <sssss> this Album ai n't touching Her first two albums no even close , but this is better than that Live Album & the last 2 albums easily . <sssss> Mary J. Bliege trying to make that Mariah Carey style comeback complete with the Beyonce Album cover look . <sssss> Mary did the right thing by releasing a New studio Album now & then hopefully next she will drop that Greatest Hits package which to me will cover Her Career up the best . <sssss> Album Wise at this stage aside from a few songs I can take or leave Her Album stuff . <sssss> this is a Pretty good set .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B000BNTM32	4	The Breakthrough is possibly the best album of Mary J. Blige 's great career . <sssss> Ms. Blige 's singing has gained a sense of maturity and she inhabits the songs with feel of someone who has experienced life 's ups and downs and is comfortable singing about both . <sssss> Several of the songs are directed at her new husband , producer Kendu Isaacs . <sssss> The best is " Baggage " where she apologizes for bringing all her emotional drama to the relationship and " Father In You " is superb classic soul where Ms. Blige thanks her husband for the ways he has made up for her absent father . <sssss> " Good Woman Down " she plays the role of mentor to young woman who went through the troubles she went through . <sssss> " I Found My Everything " is a straight-up anthem with an exuberant vocal . <sssss> There are virtually no missteps outside of her cover of U2 's " One " which drags on a bit too long .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B000BNTM32	5	I love the music of Mary J. Blige . <sssss> My favorite track on this album is Take Me As I Am . <sssss> This is an excellent song about self acceptance and loving yourself . <sssss> This is a very inspirational song for anyone who is struggling in life . <sssss> No One Will Do is a standout track . <sssss> This is a song about the love Mary has for her husband . <sssss> Another highlight on this CD is MJB Da MVP . <sssss> This song is about the ups and downs of Mary 's life and career in the music business . <sssss> It is a great dance track . <sssss> Be Without You is another gem on this album . <sssss> This is a heart wrenching hit song about missing a loved one . <sssss> One is a very strong track too . <sssss> Bono and Mary sound great singing together . <sssss> Mary gives this classic U2 song a special touch with her soulful voice . <sssss> The songs on this CD are very personal . <sssss> The Breakthrough is the best album in the career of Mary J. Blige .
A149OQJD0ASI07	B000BNTM32	4	I only gave this album 4 stars b/c I personally do n't believe in perfection . <sssss> I 'm an amazon user who knows how many of these listed albums get over-hyped with glowing reviews ( i.e. <sssss> Britney Spears , Ashanti , well , really most of commercial music out these days ) . <sssss> But this album deserves all the good reviews posted by the true Mary fans that copped this LP today . <sssss> Vocally , I think this is Mary 's BEST album by far . <sssss> I could only listen to 3/4ths of it over lunch today , but was lovin ' it all . <sssss> The track with Will.i.am could 've stood alone without him . <sssss> This is a destined classic in the vein of " What 's the 4-1-1 " , " My Life " and " Mary " . <sssss> It 's definitely an album that 'll bring new Mary fans onto the bandwagon & cement her place as the Queen of Hip Hop Soul . <sssss> There 's only one ! <sssss> Instant classic is the Mary joint with Raphael Saadiq , " I found my everything " ... <sssss> I thought I was in church ! <sssss> Trust . <sssss> Vocally , this album should give Whitney Houston hope she can get herself together and get all the way back if she wants . <sssss> ( I love me some Mary 2 death , but I NEVER thought I 'd make this last statement -- This LP is that good ! <sssss> ) .
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	B000BNTM32	4	Mary J. Blige does n't pick her album titles by accident . <sssss> " No More Drama " , " Share My World " , and " My Life " reveal a chapter of the stormy life of Ms. Blige , who had to endure a string of adversities including drug use , soured relationships , and abuse . <sssss> But if the title of her 2005 album is any indication , she 's come even closer to the inner peace that seems to have eluded her for much of her 35 years . <sssss> On " The Breakthrough " , the Queen of Hip Hop Soul delivers a reliably strong mix of r & b : some of it gritty , some of it polished , but all of it is good . <sssss> The kickoff single " Be Without You " is a well-deserved radio hit , and other notables are " Baggage " and the achingly beautiful " Father in You " . <sssss> The head-turner has to be her duet with U2 . <sssss> Together , they cover the band 's 1991 ballad " One " , and Blige 's smoky delivery reveals a newfound soulfulness that even Bono ca n't match . <sssss> " The Breakthrough " is already Blige 's biggest-selling album in years , following her much-ballyhooed reunion with P. Diddy on her last disc " Love and Life " . <sssss> 14 years since her debut , Mary J. shows no sign of slowing down , and this latest disc shows that she still has a long career ahead of her .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B000BNTM32	5	After a disappointing sixth album , Love & Life , Mary truly had a come back with this album . <sssss> Not only did it sell almost three million copies to date , 720 , 000 of those from the first week , but she was also nominated for eight Grammy awards . <sssss> ( She should 've won them all , but of course the Grammy committee has to give the golden prize to some country group just because they distastefully speak out about politics ) . <sssss> Anyways ... <sssss> I love this album . <sssss> It is one of my favorites . <sssss> All of the songs are excellent and I can listen to the whole thing straight through . <sssss> I especially love " No One Will Do " , " Alone " and " I Found My Everything " . <sssss> Those are some beautiful songs . <sssss> Mary delivers a beautiful performance on the remake of U2 's " One " . <sssss> ( She actually made me like a U2 song . <sssss> That in itself is a miracle . <sssss> ) I highly recommend that you buy this , especially at the great price Amazon offers .
A2FL41BCS486E8	B000FII324	4	When I heard the song " Promiscuous " on the radio , I could n't believe it was Nelly Furtado . <sssss> As someone who owns and loves " Whoa , Nelly " , I coul n't imagine she will go in the direction she is right now . <sssss> I am not surprised though , since I heard the excellent remix to " Get your freak on " . <sssss> I have to say I love this album . <sssss> It 's very upbeat ; there are only three slow songs . <sssss> If I did n't give it five stars , its because I really do n't like " Glow " , " Showtime " and " Do it " . <sssss> If you like dance music , buy this cd . <sssss> " Maneater " , " Afraid " , " Te busque " , " No hay igual " , " Wait for you " and " All good things " are excellent songs . <sssss> I specially love " All good things " ; the chorus is extremely beautiful .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000FII324	5	This album is very different from Nelly Furtado 's previous works but Loose is a collective and cool mix of r & b , pop , and rock . <sssss> Standout tracks include : Afraid , Maneater , Say it Right , In God 's Hands , Glow , and All Good Things ( Come to an End ) . <sssss> I wish I could speak spanish since there are two tracks in that language . <sssss> Nelly 's Folklore album was incredible and Loose is drastically different since this album is produced by Timbaland but the new sound works . <sssss> Great beats , hooks , and lyrics is what you 'll find on this hit album . <sssss> Nelly is a great artist 'cause she 's willing to try something new , not just stick to the same , predictable formula like her last records . <sssss> Say it Right is probably her strongest track she 's ever recorded even Chris Martin of Coldplay helps his creative hand to the track All Good Things , writing the music to the track . <sssss> I highly recommend this unique and creative album .
A2TAPL67U2A5HM	B000FII324	5	Loose ~ Nelly Furtado is a very good album with the amazing and good looking Nelly Furtado . <sssss> Furtado has personal vocal style and you can definitely hear that she is singing . <sssss> The lyrics are not the best but what you expect from this kind of album and I would rather have it this way then self-important lyrics that sound meandering and boring . <sssss> I love the book-let and the art-work for this album . <sssss> The photographs are crisp and clear and the font is easy on the eye . <sssss> I love what Ms Furtado is wearing and she sounds alot like Fergie and that is a compliment indeed . <sssss> This is a great album and I highly recommend it . <sssss> I will definitely give it 5 out of 5 stars .
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000FII324	4	The I 'm - Like-A-Bird Nelly Furtado is no more . <sssss> Following her dead-on-arrival sophomore album , Folklore , the once-acclaimed artist is ready to recover some lost ground . <sssss> Enlisting the help of star-producer Timbaland as well as people ranging from Nellee Hooper to Rick Nowels and Chris Martin of Coldplay , Loose is about to unleash a life on the charts . <sssss> If the first two singles are anything to go by , Furtado 's foray into the usually pedestrian and crowded hip-hop scene is anything but brilliant . <sssss> At the hands of Timbaland , first single Promiscuous is highly addictive , salacious and danceable with an unforgettable bassline . <sssss> Furtado 's transformation into a full-fledged hip-hop star is evident and convincing on video as well . <sssss> In it , Furtado shows Beyonce , Jennifer and Shakira that she too can shake that booty with aplomb . <sssss> Lyrically , the song may be as simple as talking about a pair of lustful couple looking to bed each other , but the song will definitely be a dancefloor anthem of 2006 ( much like Timbaland-helmed Missy Elliott tracks ) . <sssss> And to cash in on the success , Geffen releases Maneater to the rest of the world outside the states . <sssss> Lending his magic again , Timbaland and Furtado creates a track that brings 80 's Prince to mind . <sssss> Drabbed in extra funk and furry , our lady sings a cautionary tale of a scary woman who destroys men within sight . <sssss> If you are thinking that those are the two best tracks on the album , there 's more . <sssss> Afraid featuring Attitude opens the album off with some upbeat and urgent electronic beats . <sssss> The Chris Martin co-penned track , All Good Things Come To An End , and Say It Right are two of the most lyrical songs on the album , with Say it Right having a uplifting throw-your-hands-in-the-air feel . <sssss> Rick Nowels ' In God 's Hands is also gorgeous as hell . <sssss> And to top it off , there 's a duet with Colombian superstar Juanes on Te Basque which appears in both English and Spanish . <sssss> There 's a fair bit of everything here , but everything adds to show the maturity an artist has reached by genre infusion .
A3W0POMI33YQXQ	B000FII324	4	I 'm an R&B ; , Hip Hop , and Soul man , but ever since Nelly Furtado 's first album , Whoa Nelly , I developed a liking for her voice and style . <sssss> With songs like I 'm Like A Bird and Turn Off The Lights as well as SHHH On The Radio , in all of their popness , had managed to find airtime in my stereo . <sssss> When her second album , Folklore , dropped I was curious to if Nelly Furtado could again bring the heat and she did n't disappoint especially with songs like Powerless , Try , and Build You Up . <sssss> Nelly 's third album , Loose , is an improvement upon the first two albums and officially makes me a Nelly Furtado fan . <sssss> She hooks up with Timbaland for the undeniably catchy PROMISCUOUS which caught my ear instantly and eagerly awaited the release of this album . <sssss> Nelly 's style luminates throughout the album and her voice sounds better than ever . <sssss> The album can be listened to from front to back without skipping a track . <sssss> My favorite songs on here include Showtime ( a great midtempo ballad ) , Promiscuous , Glow , Maneater ( even though I like the remix with Lil Wayne a tad better ) , Afraid , No Hay Igual , and All Good Things . <sssss> Nelly Furtado has delivered on this album and I am really feeling it . <sssss> I urge folks to go out and buy this album ASAP .
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0	B000FII324	4	Nelly Furtado is back with her newest album LOOSE . <sssss> The album has more of an urban appeal than her past albums . <sssss> She worked with Timbaland on the CD . <sssss> There 's a lot of fun club uptempo songs like the smash hit " Promiscuous " . <sssss> I did n't expect to like this album much but it 's very well done . <sssss> The production is nice and the songs are memorable . <sssss> My favorite song is " In God 's Hands " , a very honest ballad about a love / marriage that failed . <sssss> I think the lyrics are very effective and moving . <sssss> I also like the poignant ballad " All Good Things ( Come To an End ) " . <sssss> As far as the uptempo songs go , I really like " Glow " , " Maneater " , and others . <sssss> Overal Nelly did a great job with this cd .
A1FML9FCUPV6TI	B000FII324	5	I 'm really impressed with this new cd from Nelly Furtado . <sssss> I 've known her music since she came out , and it was pleasant enough , but did n't interest me enough to pick up a cd . <sssss> That is until LOOSE . <sssss> At first I skoffed at the idea of her adopting a more R&B / hip hop sound , but it works . <sssss> Timbaland produced much of the album , and is featured on the track " Promiscuous " , which is very memorable . <sssss> So is " Maneater " , another great track . <sssss> In fact , most of the songs here will make you want to dance . <sssss> Even the songs she does n't sing in English , " No Hay Igual " and " Te Busque " are very enjoyable . <sssss> There are some great club tracks like " Glow " , " Do it " . <sssss> Overall very impressed ... definately the party album of 2006 so far !
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	B000FII324	4	On Nelly 's previous two offerings , she offered music that was both fun and pop , but was different and alternative . <sssss> Both " Whoa , Nelly " ! <sssss> and especially " Folklore " never received the credit it deserved . <sssss> So , on this cd " Loose " Nelly decided to work with Timbaland and combine hip / hop and R&B ; with her alternative pop styles to make sure it gets played on American radio . <sssss> In other words , she took a page from Gwen Stefani but does that mean she sold out ? <sssss> No , because Nelly 's fans know she was a R&B ; artist ( or very close to it ) in Canada before her debut . <sssss> I must admit , it took several listenings before I accepted this album . <sssss> But I think this album will put Nelly in the right direction to a wider fan base . <sssss> This album is still alot better than what I hear on radio today . <sssss> So give her credit . <sssss> You will also appreciate this album more in the car ... <sssss> Afraid ( 5/5 ) - wonderful song about being who you are . <sssss> Maneater ( 4/5 ) - the debut radio hit in Europe / Asia . <sssss> Promiscuous ( 5/5 ) - the debut radio hit in North America . <sssss> Glow ( 5/5 ) - love the part when she sings " around you " in a country way . <sssss> Showtime ( 4/5 ) - sounds almost genertic R&B . <sssss> ; No Hay Igual ( 5/5 ) - LOVE THIS SONG ! <sssss> Te Busque ( 5/5 ) - beautiful song . <sssss> She sings the Spanish version better . <sssss> Say It Right ( 5/5 ) - the vocals reminds me of the 80s British pop , but nicely done . <sssss> Do It ( 5/5 ) - this song could have been on Gwen 's LAMB cd , but will get people dancing . <sssss> In God 's Hands ( 4/5 ) - is this a personal song because it sounds like it . <sssss> Wait for You ( 4.5 / 5 ) - this song sounds like Tim produced it , but it still has a Nelly 's touch to it . <sssss> All Good Things ( 3.5 / 5 ) Nice song , but it does not belong on this album . <sssss> Also , try N. American fans , try and get the b-side to Maneater ... asong called Undercover . <sssss> Its good .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000FII324	1	sine Nelly Furtado 's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we got ta get you some grooves , lets get Timberland . <sssss> Timberland during the mid to late 90 's hit his peak as a Beat-Maker , but never really added anything to himself beyond beats & he eventually fell out of Groove . <sssss> Nelly Furtado is now forced to play catch up with Gwen Stefani in a attempt at a Accessible sound & style that while has a minute or two coolness , loses it 's appeal rather sooner than later . <sssss> vocally she is a lightweight . <sssss> her best attempts at coming back are on places where Timberland ca n't be found . <sssss> this is only her 3rd release & the record company already is pushing her to being a Gwen Stefani Clone . <sssss> the irony is that Nelly is more comfortable in this style than what I heard on Gwen 's Solo Album , but on the real neither album made much of a impression on me on a whole .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B000FII324	5	` Loose ' is Nelly Furtado 's comeback album , after the lackluster reception her last album ` Folklore ' received ( though it featured the brilliant ' Try ' ) . <sssss> With the bulk of the album produced by Timbaland , it 's a dance/pop/hip hop / Spanish-tinged affair which took her to the top of the Billboard charts for the first time . <sssss> Led off by the smash hit pair of singles ; ` Promiscuous ' ( US # 1 UK top 10 ) , and ` Maneater ' ( UK # 1 ) . <sssss> She sounds more relaxed and like she 's had loads of fun recording this - loose like the title of the album . <sssss> Other standouts are ` Say it right ' , the eighties sounding ` Do it ' , the rapped / sung ` Attitude ' ( an inspirational song with lyrics like ` We all have the choice to take the lead or follow / I want to feel the light shine on me ' , and a brief REM sample ) , and ` Glow ' . <sssss> There are still ballads , always her fort&eacute; in my opinion . <sssss> The lovely Spanish / English ` Te busque ' . <sssss> The middle eastern tinged ` Wait for you ' , the free and easy ` Showtime ' ( great layering of harmonies ) , and the beautiful wistful ` All good things ( come to an end ) ' ( co written by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin ) . <sssss> I 've got the UK version which features 2 extra songs ; the Janet Jackson styled ` Let my hair down ' , and the sunny bounce of ` Somebody to love ' ( great Spanish guitars ) . <sssss> A great album ! <sssss> Here 's hoping she can maintain the regained creative momentum .
A37Y9UJBF3C32C	B000FII324	5	I remember when she first came out I thought she was talented different and really liked Im like a Bird ! <sssss> I had n't really heard anything that she had did in 5 or 6 years . <sssss> I had almost written her off as a one hit wonder . <sssss> I remember when this cd first came out . <sssss> I thought wow she def . <sssss> changed ! <sssss> That 's what everybody said ! <sssss> I actually heard the first single on myspace and I actually thought it was pretty good . <sssss> It was the album that really made Timbaland the superstar producer that he is today . <sssss> It 's more Timbaland 's work then Nelly 's which is obvious . <sssss> I thought this album 's singles were excellent and amazing and had the best beats of any song out there . <sssss> Say it Right had to be one of my favorite songs for a while . <sssss> I thought the beats were slick , the video was hot , and everything else was done almost perfectly . <sssss> Maneater was so different when I heard it was like wow Timbaland 's work really shines through on this track . <sssss> The pulsating beat gets louder and faster , and it 's got really funny lyrics . <sssss> I thought do it again was excellent , a little slower but I loved Missy 's rap on it . <sssss> Overall , there 's very little filler , if any , on this album . <sssss> I remember this album had to be the hottest album out there when it came out ! <sssss> If anybody loves pop or techno music this is the album to get !
AMP7TQRWAIE84	B000N2G3RY	4	-- Rehab ******* 1/2 Overplayed to the high Heavens and is one of the worst tracks here . <sssss> However , love the line : " Ooo / I just need a friend " ! <sssss> 7.5 / 10 -- You Know I 'm No Good ********** One of the , if not the best tracks on the entire thing ! <sssss> Like the video . <sssss> But love the lyrics ! <sssss> 10/10 -- Me & Mr. Jones ******** 1/2 This is the first time I 've heard this one . <sssss> I like it , it 's superior to Rehab in almost every way ( save for my favorite line ) and I think it 's one of my favorites . <sssss> 8.5 / 10 -- Just Friends ********** 1/2 Love this one now ! <sssss> 10.5 / 10 -- Back to Black ********* 1/2 Loving the lyrics . <sssss> The symphony , violins and the piano . <sssss> And the atmosphere it creates . <sssss> Definitely my third favorite song here . <sssss> " You go back to Her / And I go back to Black " . <sssss> \ m / 9.5 / 10 -- Love is a Losing Game ********* Love this one . <sssss> Heard it before . <sssss> It was my favorite but I think that You Know I 'm No Good takes it by a hair . <sssss> This track is much more laid-back though . <sssss> 9/10 -- Tears Dry on their Own ******* 1/2 I like this one . <sssss> Not a favorite , but it 's OK . <sssss> 7.5 / 10 -- Wake Up Alone *********** I am obsessed with the title . <sssss> I feel the same about the song . <sssss> The lyrics are real and somewhat gritty . <sssss> The production sounds like something extremely dreary and seems as if someone will commit suicide quite soon . <sssss> I LOVE it !! <sssss> Guess this is my new favorite !!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> 11/10 -- Some Unholy War ***** Bored me to tears . <sssss> The only track that is terrible and I do n't understand how it made the cut . <sssss> Glad it 's shorter than 2 1 / 2 minutes . <sssss> 5/10 -- He Can Only Hold Her ******* 3/4 Again , I love the title . <sssss> Decent closer and the lyrics are decent as well . <sssss> However , the highlight is actually the beat ; Upbeat and lovely . <sssss> That 's where it 's at ! <sssss> 7.75 / 1086 . <sssss> 25 10 = 8.6258.63 = 4.324.32 stars .
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	B000N2G3RY	1	Amy Winehouse is so freakin ' ugly , how does she sell albums ? <sssss> A total druggie , alcoholic , and god how much does she weigh , 45 pounds ? <sssss> She is a terrible role model , she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan . <sssss> Winehouse ca n't sing , she thinks she is some rockin ' soul singer from the 1960 's but she is n't , she is just a wannabe . <sssss> Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album , but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now , then this album should make you happy .
A200C7YQJ45LRR	B000N2G3RY	4	Amy Winehouse : when you have a name like that , it seems that you just HAVE to get into the entertainment business ( yes , that 's her real name ) . <sssss> Although she released a critically acclaimed album back in 2003 , I never heard of her until " Rehab " was all over the place this year . <sssss> So in contrast to her father-in-law 's advice ( for those that do n't know , he advised people not to buy the album in order to convince Amy and her husband to stop abusing drugs ) , I finally picked up Back to Black , and I do n't plan on putting it down any time soon . <sssss> There are plenty of highlights , like " Love Is a Losing Game " , " He Can Only Hold Her " and " Wake Up Alone " . <sssss> And aside from her vocals , Amy also has a certain creativity in her lyrics : check " Some Unholy War " or " Just Friends " for proof of this . <sssss> And you should already know how great " Rehab " and " You Know I 'm No Good " are . <sssss> Speaking of that song though , the reason why I knocked off half a star is because at the end of the album there is a " remix " of it featuring Ghostface Killah , and it 's really one of those pointless remixes whose only real difference is a rap in the middle of the song ; also , although Ghost 's rap is good , it gets unnecessarily loud toward the end . <sssss> But despite Back to Black barely being over half an hour long , it 's still classic material , so if you do n't have it yet , WTF are you sittin ' around for ? <sssss> Pick it up ! <sssss> Anthony Rupert
A1AYEI2SNFPYES	B000N2G3RY	5	When I first saw the image of a big-hair woman ( think Marge Simpson ) with thick lashes , I laughed . <sssss> This woman looks like a total wreck and joke . <sssss> What I did n't know was that I would eventually be addicted to Amy Winehouse 's Back to Black . <sssss> Like the last song on the album , she 's like a drug herself . <sssss> Unabashedly loud and trendy , Amy Winehouse has the sort of smothering voice that absolutely belittles her 23 years of age . <sssss> Back to Black has the voice and soul sensibilities of a mature veteran . <sssss> But here , we have a young woman bucking all the current trends in R&B ; without the need for senseless featued rap guest star and dishing out all the unsavoury aspects of her misaligned life thus far . <sssss> And that 's the richness and diversity of the album . <sssss> Amy rocks and she knows it . <sssss> She sings of love and pain from personal experience , all nothing we have not heard of but she does it so well in that old swinging 60 's Motown style that every beat and note eventually gets stuck in that head of yours . <sssss> Think of Rehab , you ca n't help but dance to that addictive beat . <sssss> Think of You Know I 'm Not Good and you might also feel that her unfaithfulness is justified . <sssss> He Can Only Hold Her , Back to Black and the bonus Addictive further consolidates her position as the new star ! <sssss> In her death , I realise how Back to Black will forever be christened as her best and most introspective record - the record that mirrors her life from addiction to heartbreak and a life of mockery . <sssss> Gone too soon .
AQ9XQBOAHB999	B000N2G3RY	5	Amy is one of those singers or persons that calls the attention . <sssss> Her voice and style are unique . <sssss> This album from my point of view , is a piece of music that everybody should have , it 's a gem because it can fit any style . <sssss> It 's classic and trendy , fun and blue at the same time and that 's something very difficult to make . <sssss> You could think that you 're listening a very good remastered album from the 50 's . <sssss> She makes me remember Della Reese . <sssss> This is Amy 's second album , her first one is " FRANK " from 2003 . <sssss> It was a hit in the U.K but was n't released in America until 2007 . <sssss> ( That one is also very good ) . <sssss> Amy 's explosion came with the international massive hit " REHAB " . <sssss> I think that I do n't have to comment it because I Think that everybody knows the song . <sssss> The impact of the hit was enough to make her a winner of 5 Grammy awards and reaching # 1 in Europe and # 2 in the U.S plus getting her album to the Multi-platinum status . <sssss> In overall the album is mellow and rough ( actually it 's not easy to make a review of this album ) . <sssss> The most beat-up songs in the album besides " REHAB " are . <sssss> " YOU KNOW THAT I 'M NO GOOD " ( there are 2 version of this song on this edition . <sssss> The original which is track 2 and track 11 , that is a remix . <sssss> I find track 2 better than 11 ) , " BACK TO BLACK " , " JUST FRIENDS " , that has a reggae touch and " TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN " . <sssss> The other are softer songs specially " LOVE IS A LOSING GAME " , which is the softest one . <sssss> If you have n't heard much of Amy 's music , give this one a try . <sssss> You may not like it very much in the beginning but after a couple of times , you start to really like it . <sssss> That heppened to me . <sssss> I would start listening first to me songs that I mentioned before " Love is a Losing game " .
A9Q28YTLYREO7	B000N2G3RY	2	i have heard this album and I do n't get all the hype . <sssss> AMy Winehouse is creative to a extent , but she sounds like Ronnie Spector trying to channel Lauyren Hill and it has a mixed reaction . <sssss> the retro Girl Group style and sound of the 60 's is charming for a while and then it starts to wear then and feels gimmicky after a while . <sssss> Production and Musicianship is solid , and the writing has some moments , but the overall vibe does n't knock me out .
A24N1BAS3CU27H	B000N2G3RY	5	Uk songstress Amy Winehouse 's brilliant 2003 debut ` Frank ' earned her lots of critical acclaim , and even won the Ivor Novello award ( for songwriting ) , but largely flew under the radar commercially , with its retro soul / jazz sound ( that Christina Aguilera is using now ) , her raw and raspy vocal delivery ( mature beyond her young years ) , and very frank lyrics . <sssss> She returns on ` Back to black ' , her sophomore disc , which is off to a blazing start in the UK ; Top 10 for the album , and lead off single , the horn sprinkled midtempo Motown-ish ` Rehab ' , a song about a battle to get her into rehab , fictitious or autobiographical , we do n't know . <sssss> The horn sprinkled ` You know I 'm no good ' has a jazzy / tango sound set to skittery hip hop beats . <sssss> Very catchy and one of my favourites . <sssss> ` Me and Mr Jones ' is a downtempo retro soul/jazz/blues song that sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s . <sssss> There 's a slight reggae feel to ` Just friends ' . <sssss> The title track ` Back to black ' is a beautiful midtempo Motown-ish song with excellent harmonies , and haunting / creepy sound effects . <sssss> ` Love is a losing game ' is a lovely ballad , and continuing the Motown influence , the beautiful ` Tears dry on their own ' has traces of ` Aint no mountain high enough ' . <sssss> Awesome song and another of my favourites . <sssss> ` Wake up alone ' is a tender ballad with soothing harmonies , the brief ` Unholy war ' is a mellow blues / jazzy song , ` He can hold her ' is more upbeat with a hip hop beat and horns flitting in and out . <sssss> Closing is the sunny , upbeat , Motown-ish ` Addictions ' . <sssss> Retro sounding and beautiful . <sssss> This is a stunning album , and definitely one of the very best released all year !! 
A14GK0E64J0WAS	B000N2G3RY	4	Amy Winehouse is big in the UK and it comes as a surprise to many that this album is not her first , indeed her 2003 " Frank " album foreshadows the success of her second album , which was 3 years in the making . <sssss> " Back to Black " ( 11 tracks , 36 min . <sssss> ) starts off with the song that has given Amy her breakthrough in the US , the quirky " Rehab " , which is actually not nearly the best song on this set . <sssss> Much better are for example the stomping " You Know I 'm No Good " , and the title track ( with biting lines like " We said goodbye with words / I died a hundred times / You go back to her / And I go back to black " , wow ) . <sssss> Also interesting is " Tears Dry On Their Own " , which reflects Amy 's strong influence by the Motown sound -- this song hums along perfectly along with " Ai n't No Montains High Enough " . <sssss> The album closes with a second version of " You Know I 'm No Good " , with a guest-rapper ( I think it badly misfires ) . <sssss> I happen to catch Amy live at the Coachella festival a few months ago , and there is no denying her stage presence , and her house band was stellar . <sssss> That said , I do n't know if at this point her mainstream success in the US ( the album is a mainstay in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 ) is due to the music , or the phenomenon that she seems to have become . <sssss> Only the future will tell whether " Back to Black " was a one-time , quirky smash , or whether Amy can continue to build from there . <sssss> For another album in the same vein , check out Lily Allen 's debut album " Alright , Still " .
A1GN8UJIZLCA59	B000N2G3RY	5	Amy Winehouse 's second album Back To Black is a throwback to the 60 's girl group sounds . <sssss> Owing a debt to the Shangri-La 's , Ms. Winehouse combines a modern lyrically approach ( a liberal dose of the four letter words ) with the R&B influences of those girl groups . <sssss> " Rehab " kicks off the album on a brassy note with Ms. Winehouse unabashedly refusing to get help for her problems with an emphatic no , no , no chorus . <sssss> " Me & Mr. Jones " is not a remake of the Billy Paul classic , " Me & Mrs. Jones " , but a doo-wop inflected number . <sssss> " You Know I 'm No Good " have a Memphis soul feel , the title track is a smoldering number with a Phil Spector Wall of Sound influence and " Some Unholy War " brings to mind the 60 's Atlantic soul sound . <sssss> " Tears Dry On Their Own " basically nicks the riff from " Ai n't No Mountain High Enough " , but Ms. Winehouse really gives the song a workout . <sssss> While Ms. Winehouse is obviously influenced by 60 's American music , the lyrics and feel of the album are completely British . <sssss> Ms. Winehouse has a tremendous voice and a sharp pen , lets hope she 'll be a force to reckon with for a long time .
AE31M52VLKOG6	B000N2G3RY	5	I love this new CD from Amy Winehouse . <sssss> My favorite track is " Rehab " . <sssss> This is a very groovy sounding song about someone with a drinking problem who refuses to go to rehab . <sssss> I love all the instruments on this song especially the trumpet and saxophone . <sssss> " Just Friends " is another hit on this CD . <sssss> I love the musical arrangement of this track . <sssss> It makes me want to dance . <sssss> " You Know I 'm Not Good " is the sexiest song I 've ever heard about a person being unfaithful . <sssss> This track is another one of my favorites . <sssss> " Back To Black " is another highlight here . <sssss> This track has a 60 's retro sound with the superb piano playing . <sssss> This song is about a dysfunctional relationship between two people . <sssss> Amy sounds so soulful on " Love is a Losing Game " . <sssss> I love the slow tempo of this song very much . <sssss> " Some Unholy War " is another good track . <sssss> It is about supporting a loved one in a time of crisis . <sssss> This is a very enjoyable CD to listen to .
A1S2IY37JU93XS	B000N2G3RY	5	When the buzz on Amy Winehouse began here in the United States , I became very intrigued . <sssss> Not only by the music aspect , but her personality and little tabloid troubles back home . <sssss> I heard " You Know I 'm No Good " and " Rehab " and I instantly knew I was going to buy Back To Black as soon as it hit stores domestically . <sssss> ( Plus , I am an absolute sucker for these UK imports like M.I.A. <sssss> , Lily Allen , Joss Stone and now Amy . <sssss> ) After listening , all I can say is ' wow ! <sssss> ' It truly is that good . <sssss> I love her vocals , which remind me a lot of Lauryn Hill . <sssss> ( And the last minute or two of " Just Friends " remind me a lot of Hill 's " Ex Factor " . <sssss> ) The production flawlessly replicates the old school soul and adds a few modern touches . <sssss> The lyrics are true-to-life , blunt , raw and quite emotional . <sssss> I loved every song , except for the unnecessary remix of " You Know ... " with Ghostface Killah . <sssss> How can so much quality be packed into 10 songs and a little more than 30 minutes of music ? <sssss> The world may never know . <sssss> I highly recommend buying this album .
A23IOPI0D1OG7V	B000N2G3RY	5	Someone finally got it right . <sssss> " Back to Black " both the song and the entire album , can and should change everything . <sssss> Amy Winehouse , she , a vocalist of seductive , spine-tingling , depth and wicked lyricist ( check the razor sharp " Me and Mr. Jones " ) and her brilliant producers have made an album that does n't simply evoke the sound and spirit of great 60 's soul , but actually expands on it by adding a modern lyrical cynicism ( " You Know I 'm No Good " and opener " Rehab " ) to these huge sounding , expansive tracks . <sssss> Imagine " Dusty In Memphis " with a dash of evil , less innocence and a slightly sinister edge , then you 'll get it . <sssss> A TERRIFIC release .
